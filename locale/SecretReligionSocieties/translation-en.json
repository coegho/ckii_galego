Practicing their secret rituals in the name of the Allfather, they will accept any kind of warrior who can stand with them in the struggle against the chaos and desolation that other faiths seem intent on bringing upon the world.",
    "secret_religious_society_baltic_pagan_desc_REAL": "As children of Dievas, the hidden followers of the Baltic faith know that everything is connected through the divine spirit, even those who oppress them. So it is that they continue their work unabated, spreading the words of the High Priest even among those who are at first unwilling to listen. Through the divine commonality of Perkunas, Saule or Daugava, they believe anyone can find a home with them.",
    "secret_religious_society_finnish_pagan_desc_REAL": "Even under the rule of another religion, the Suomenusko faith lives strong in some people. Communing with nature, they find their gods in the quiet places of the world. Among the trees, the brooks and the light of the moon, where they worship their divine kings in secret. But silence does not last forever, and it will soon be shattered by the storming in of Ukko on his chariot of thunder, his bolts of lightning striking the faithless to ash.",
    "secret_religious_society_slavic_pagan_desc_REAL": "Their identities marked by hidden axe amulets illustrating their devotion to Perun, underground Slavic curates pray in wild storms, their voices consumed by the thunder. In time they know that those who hunt them will be as powerless against the coming of Perun as the oak is against the lightning.",
    "secret_religious_society_tengri_pagan_desc_REAL": "No matter how far you travel, and no matter what unbelievers say, you are always under the Heavenly Father, and standing upon the Earth Mother. This is how the followers of Tengri can be so certain in their faith that they follow it even in the face of persecution. All they have to do to prove their faith is to lift their eyes towards Tengri of the Blue Sky above, feel the protection nature provides, and let their Wind Horses ride in prayer to a better place.",
    "secret_religious_society_aztec_desc_REAL": "The faithful Aztecs bravely worship their high God, the warrior Huitzilopochtli, despite being surrounded by enemies on every side. If they stay true and send him human sacrifices as gifts, he will lead them to a new dawn, a glorious conquest of fire and blood.",
    "secret_religious_society_aztec_reformed_desc_REAL": "The faithful Aztecs bravely worship their high God, the warrior Huitzilopochtli, despite being surrounded by enemies on every side. If they stay true and send him human sacrifices as gifts, he will lead them to a new dawn, a glorious conquest of fire and blood.",
    "secret_religious_society_west_african_pagan_desc_REAL": "As preachers proselytize, there are those who play their part, but in secret turn to the forces around them. No other gods have shown them the small miracles of the world, or the sheer divinity of life and existence. They tell each other stories of how faith does not reside in some otherworldly realm, but in the trees around them, the rocks by their feet, and the waters they drink of.",
    "secret_religious_society_zun_pagan_desc_REAL": "The secret followers of Zun have little need for foreign faiths. The answer to every theological challenge and every moment of doubt is right in the sky above them, every day, without fail. It is what brings life and hope, deserving of every prostration. Just as Zun never fails to bring warmth to the earth and drive the night away, his followers will rise on the other side of their own long night.",
