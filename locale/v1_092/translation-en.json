    "tut_8b_8": "What instigates a Crusade is that the Pope appoints an area that needs to be conquered in the name of the Catholic church. For him to be able to do that, it must currently be held by Muslims or Pagans. When he does this, a special Crusade war will begin which you are able to join by going to the Pope's diplomatic interactions and choosing 'Offer to Join War'.",

Plots can also be chosen from the character portrait screen by finding a character you wish to plot against and clicking the 'Choose a Plot' button.
