His descendants would be Kings of France in 1066. Although by 1322 the main line would die out, cadet branches still ruled in 1337 as Kings of France, Portugal, Naples, Hungary and Navarre. Cadet branches would also hold the Duchies of Brittany, Burgundy, Bourbon, Provence and Achaea. One further cadet branch would hold the dignity of Emperor as Latin Emperors of Constantinople. Truly the greatest dynasty of medieval Europe.",
    "DYN2_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Habsburg. On the face of it, things were not looking very good for the Habsburg family in 1066. As minor Swiss counts, their status inside the Empire was fairly negligible compared to great territorial magnates of 11th century Germany. A policy of tactical marriages saw the family lands expand steadily, and it was during the chaos that gripped the Empire in the late 13h and early 14th century that the family were elected to the office of Holy Roman Empire. Although unable to hold the office they were able to use this a springboard to secure the Duchy of Austria for the dynasty. With this power base, the family would go on to dominate the politics of Central Europe until 1918.",
    "DYN3_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Rurikovich, descendants of the Swedish Viking Rurik who established a state in Rus (now in modern Russia and Ukraine) in the 9th century. The policy of dividing lands between heirs led to the state fragmenting and the various family groups would feud with each other. This left them too divided to cope with the 13th century Mongol invasion. The great principalities fell one by one to Batu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, and were forced to pay tribute to the victorious Mongols. The family itself survived and would rise again...",
    "DYN4_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House d'Ivrea, a dynasty with illustrious ancestors, but by 1066 very much down on its luck - from Kings of Italy to minor counts in Burgundy. It looked like a dynasty whose day had passed. Then came a lucky marriage and the Kingdoms of Castile and Leon passed into the family holdings, turning House d'Ivrea again into one of the key players on the European stage.",
    "DYN5_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Piast. The eponymous founder of this dynasty was by legend a wheelwright before becoming King of Poland. The family held Poland throughout the period, and despite the Kingdom being split were able to unite the country and make Poland strong again. Other members of the Dynasty were part of the Holy Roman Empire as Dukes of Silesia. In 1337 Poland was ruled by its greatest Piast King and preparing to advance against the Mongols.",
    "DYN6_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Komnenos. If we exclude Isaac, who had launched a successful coup to become Emperor in 1057, the Komnenos family were loyal servants of the Byzantine Empire. In the chaos following the Seljuk victory at Manzikert, the Komnenos family followed that proud family tradition and launched another coup. For the next 100 years the dynasty would halt the decline of the Byzantine Empire under what we know as the Komnenian restoration. Ironically, the family would be toppled in a palace coup, but they would continue to rule as Emperors in Trebizond",
    "DYN7_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Plantagenet, who started off as a cadet branch of the elder house of Anjou. Geoffrey, the founder of the dynasty, was left with the family lands in France when his father went off to Jerusalem to become King. The Plantagenet family had a power base in France, and through marriages inherited the Kingdom of England and large parts of France. The French inheritance would lead to an ongoing conflict with France and the Hundred Years War.",
    "DYN8_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Ylving. Coming to the throne in Denmark in 1047, the house of Ylving was one of only two royal families to still hold kingdoms in 1337. Although there were several attempts at expansion, Denmark only gained small amount of land in Estonia, as most would be gained and then lost. The dynasty itself managed to survive and prosper in an era of chaos and turmoil, which is no mean feat.  ",
    "DYN10_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Welf, a dynasty very much down on its luck in 1066. By 1100 that had all changed. Control of two of the most powerful duchies in Germany and substantial lands in Italy made them the second most powerful family in Germany after the Hohenstaufen. One member of the Welf family would even gain the title of Emperor, but in the struggles would also weaken the family and much of the lands would be lost. The family would consolidate its holdings in Northern Germany as Dukes of Brunswick and remain a player in Imperial politics.",
    "DYN11_DESC": "With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House de Genève, who were counts of Geneva in 1066.

Click the portrait to find out who your character is.",
    "HINT_SPLASH_START": "As a new feudal lord, your first priority is to secure an heir. If you do not have a legitimate heir when your character dies, it's Game Over. Other pressing matters that need your attention will appear as Alerts along the top of the screen.",
    "HINT_SPLASH_TIME": "Crusader Kings II is a Pausable Real-Time game. This means that you can issue commands both while the game is paused and when the clock is running. To pause or unpause the game, click the date in the upper-right corner or press the Spacebar. Use the plus and minus symbols to speed time up or to slow it down.",
    "HINT_SPLASH_VICTORY": "Unless your dynasty dies out or you lose your last piece of land, the game will end in 1452, and you can compare your success with that of other dynasties from real history.",
    "HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TITLE": "The Character View",
    "HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_2": "The bottom half of the Character View is dedicated to close relations. Vassals are feudal lords in fief to the selected character. The Court tab lists the people at the court of the character. Allies are lords who can be called into wars, and the 'Abroad' tab lists courtiers who are currently away for some reason.",
    "HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Every character in the game has an opinion of every other character. The tooltip for the opinion explains the reasons in detail. Computer controlled characters will act in accordance with their opinions.",
    "HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_4": "The Dynasty of the character is shown in the top right of the screen. A valid heir always has to be of your own Dynasty. You should strive to expand your dynasty and make sure members hold as many titles as possible.",
    "HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_5": "Some portraits have little symbols on them. A star means it is the character you currently play, a crown signifies your heir, and a little drop means the character is of your dynasty.",

    "HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_1": "Every ruler has a Council to help administer the realm. Each of the five positions on the Council has a primary attribute - Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue and Learning. The councillor's skill value is added to the ruler's for all matters of state.",
    "HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_2": "Councillors can be sent to a county on the map to perform various jobs. For example, the Court Chaplain can be dispatched to convert counties and the characters in them to your religion.",

    "HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This screen allows you to change the laws of your demesne. There are two main types of law - succession laws and regular laws. Succession laws determine who the rightful heir is, regular laws concern matters of governance.",
    "HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_2": "Succession laws are difficult to change because different succession laws completely alter the dynamic of the game. Different groups of people will tend to like or dislike different succession laws depending on how it affects their chances of succeeding.",
    "HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_4": "Kingdoms are also unique in that they have separate succession laws even if they are currently ruled by the same king. Therefore, united kingdoms might well split up and once more be ruled by two different characters when the old king dies.",
    "HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_5": "The characters who are currently second and third in the line of succession are called Pretenders. They will usually dislike the current heir and even the current ruler.",
    "HINT_TECH_VIEW_TITLE": "The Technology View",
    "HINT_TECH_VIEW_TEXT_1": "Technology was fairly static in medieval times. Nevertheless, certain advances were made over the centuries. In Crusader Kings II, every county on the map has separate levels of technology.",
    "HINT_TECH_VIEW_TEXT_3": "While in the Technology View, hovering over a county on the map will show the advancement levels there rather than in your capital.",
    "HINT_MIL_VIEW_TITLE": "The Military View",
    "HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This screen gives you an overview of all your military assets and allows you to raise your levies and those of your vassals, either one by one or all at once.",
    "HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_2": "The 'Vassals' tab lists all your direct vassals and their opinions of you. The less they like you, the smaller the part of their levies they will send when you raise them. Vassals will pay for the maintenance of their troops even when under your command. Therefore, vassals will dislike you more for every year you keep their levies raised.",
    "HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_3": "The 'Mercenaries' tab lists all available mercenary companies that you can hire. Mercenaries are professional soldiers who fight well as long as they are paid well, but if your coffers run empty they might decide to abandon you - or even defect to your enemies!",
    "HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TITLE": "The Intrigue View",
    "HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Plots are a shady but effective way of achieving less innocuous goals. Unlike Ambitions, Plots require backers, co-conspirators, to succeed. The progress of a plot is measured by its Power, representing the collective influence and position of the plotters.",
    "HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TEXT_4": "Your Spymaster will discover plots depending on his Intrigue skill (unless he himself is in on it!) Once you know of a plot, you can try to convince the plotter to end his or her scheming, or you can resort to other measures...",
    "HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TITLE": "The Diplomacy View",
    "HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This view lists all the actions you can take towards another character. Note that, unless a character is a ruler, it is usually their liege who actually responds to your proposals.",
    "HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TEXT_2": "When you have sent a proposal to a character, it will take them some time to respond. However, you can see their likely answer, and their reasoning, even before you send your proposal.",

    "HINT_REL_VIEW_TITLE": "The Religious View",
    "HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This view summarizes the state of your religion. Most religions have a formal head, like the Pope, the Caliph or the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Religions also have a 'Moral Authority' value, which affects how fast heresies spread and how easy it is to convert counties and characters to the religion.",
    "HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_2": "The chief pontiff of a religion has various special abilities, like calling for a Holy War, or granting a divorce. If the moral authority of a religion is too low, these abilities are disabled. It is a good idea to have good relations with your chief pontiff in order to make use of his powers.",
    "HINT_REALM_VIEW_TITLE": "The Title View",
    "HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This upper part of this screen contains information about a landed title. Titles are organized into a tree-like structure with Empire tier titles on top and baronies at the bottom. There are both 'de facto' and 'de jure' trees, and you can toggle between them.",
    "HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_2": "There are quick buttons to Create, Usurp, Claim or Revoke titles from this screen, if applicable. There is a also a button to display all living claimants to the title, and a button to show a list of previous holders.",
    "HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_3": "The lower part of the Title View shows information about the title holder's entire Demesne and its budget.",
    "HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TITLE": "The Character Browser",
    "HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TEXT_1": "The Character Browser allows you to search for various categories of characters.",

    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TITLE": "The County View",
    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_1": "The map is divided into a number of Counties, each containing a number of landed Holdings - Castles, Cities and Temples. Counties are ruled by Counts, and holdings are ruled by Barons (or cultural equivalents.)",
    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_2": "The Holdings are the basis of the game's economy and military systems. Holdings provides tax income and a military levy. Castles have the best levies but the least tax. Cities are rich, but have poor levies. Temples are both rich and provide good levies, but are hard to defend.",
    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Counties have a religion and a culture, representing the broad population layers. The people of a county tend to dislike rulers of a foreign culture or religion, which can cause peasant uprisings.",
    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_4": "Counties also have different levels of technological advancement, which tend to spread from one province to its neighbors.",
    "HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_5": "The capital Holding of a County is always held by the count. The other holdings can be held by anyone.",
    "HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TITLE": "The Holding View",
    "HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_1": "This view shows details about a Holding and allows its owner to build various improvements.",
    "HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_2": "The collection of Holdings held by a single character is called a Demesne. You can cycle through the holdings in your demesne with the arrows.",
    "HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Some buildings cannot be built until a certain technology exists in the province. Others might have another building as a prerequisite.",
    "HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_4": "The owner the Holding, or his liege and above, can change the name of the Holding by clicking the name and editing it.",
    "HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TITLE": "The Unit View",
    "HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_1": "Units are collections of regiments or ships, which can be raised from Holdings or provided by Mercenaries or Holy Orders.",
    "HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_2": "Armies are organized into three parts - left flank, centre, and right flank. Each part is led by one of the regiment commanders. The commander of the Centre is considered commander of the whole army.",
    "HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Armies take attrition losses in Counties that cannot supply them. Check the supply limit in the County View.",
    "HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TITLE": "The Combat View",
    "HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_1": "During combat, the three parts of both armies face off - left flank against right flank, centre against centre, and right flank against left.",
    "HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_2": "Combat starts in Skirmish Phase, when archers and horse archers are paramount unit types. Eventually, the flanks will close with each other and enter Melee phase, where heavy infantry and knights shine. When a flank flees, its opponent will be in Pursue phase, trying to run down as many enemies as possible. Here, light cavalry is best.",
    "HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_3": "During each combat phase, flank commanders will pick a tactic depending on their Martial skill, which largely determines how effectively their troops fight.",
    "HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TITLE": "The Siege View",
    "HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_1": "The length of a Siege is mainly determined by the fort level of the Holding, the number of defenders and the number of besiegers.",
    "HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_2": "If the besiegers have fewer troops than the defenders, the siege will be ineffective.",
    "HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_3": "Siege ends when the morale of the defenders reaches zero (or the attackers leave or are driven off.)",
