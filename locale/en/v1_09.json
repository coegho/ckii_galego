Only the head of the dynasty has access to the vault keys, but the stories of piles upon piles of golden coins, deep enough for a man to dive around in like a porpoise, or burrow through like a gopher, must surely be false.",
    "fp_vault_2_desc": "These secret passages run through the entire palace, and enable those in the know to quickly move from one end to the other without being seen. By pulling on the right candelabrum, an unassuming bookshelf or a lit fireplace might slide open. Perfect for escaping would-be assassins or awkward social gatherings.",
    "fp_vault_3_desc": "This hidden chamber inside the palace can only be reached through one of the secret passages, and even then several special keys are required. It serves as a well-protected retreat for the head of the dynasty, where he or she can safely plot the conquest of the world without irritating distractions.",
