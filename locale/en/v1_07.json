But there is hope - the great general Alexios Komnenos has just seized the throne from the corrupt Nikephoros III. Alexios - whose life was documented by his daughter Anna in 'the Alexiad' - and his successors would halt the decline of the Empire and push back the Turkish invaders from western Anatolia, buying more time for the ailing remnants of the old Roman Empire. For now, Anatolia is ruled by Suleyman I, a member of the Seljuk dynasty, who arrogantly calls his new state the 'Sultanate of Rum' (Rome).",

The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.",
