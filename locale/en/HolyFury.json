    "EVTDESCHFP20547": "I hoped the pain would be over with the child out of me, but the internal bleeding I have suffered by giving birth to [From.GetHerHim] has made everything worse.

Nearly everything was consumed by the infinite darkness still visible at night, except for the land miraculously protected by [GetHighGodName].

In the end, the gods were driven out, repelled to the far confines of the universe, where their remains amalgamated through rage and vengeance, into what we now call [GetRandomEvilGodName]. The rebellious mortal himself was drenched in divine blood, becoming [GetHighGodName], a godlike entity, as strong as the will of all mortals on Earth.

As he drew close to death, the [GetPriestTitle] warned that his good followers were still at risk, due to the numerous masses of wicked heathens performing decadent rituals and increasing [GetRandomEvilGodName]'s influence.

He then started carving a new face into another stump, and when he was finished it sprung to life in the form of [GetHighGodName].

Interpreting these numbers is a complex task, and new connections are made almost every year. It is said that the truth has been hidden behind complex formulas by [GetHighGodName].
