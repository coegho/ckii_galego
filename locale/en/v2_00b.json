    "EVTDESC_SOA_2609": "This chivalric order owes its name to Santiago Matamoros, or Saint James the Moorslayer as he is known in other parts of the world. The Order of Santiago enjoys the official sponsorship of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church and its knights have all sworn to purge entire realms of heathens and heretics if so requested by a [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler.",
    "EVTDESC_SOA_2709": "The Order of Calatrava is the most recent addition to the soldiers of the Cross, having just been endorsed in a decree issued by the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church. These knights take their name from a castle recovered in Iberia from the clutches of the Moslem infidel, and they stand ready to combat heathens and defend the pious in the name of any [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler who is willing to provide for their upkeep.",
    "EVTDESC39100": "A decree has been issued confirming the formation of a new religious military order - the Knights of St. John. The Knights, who have already protected and cared for sick pilgrims in Jerusalem for some time, now have the full weight of the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church behind them. Pious [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers may call on their support in wars against heretics and heathens, but they will not fight those of their own faith.",
    "EVTDESC39101": "A new Christian military order has been founded by a small group of wealthy knights. The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon - or the Knights Templar for short - have sworn to protect pilgrims travelling through the Holy Land. The [Root.Religion.GetName] church fully endorses the Order, and this will allow pious [Root.Religion.GetName] rulers to call on their aid, though they will only fight against heretics and infidels.",
    "EVTDESC39102": "The Order of Brothers of the German House of Saint Mary in Jerusalem has been formed, sponsored by the [Root.Religion.GetName] Church and the Holy Roman Emperor. The Teutonic Order, much like the Knights of St. John and the Knights Templar, primarily protect and care for pilgrims to the Holy Land, but will serve any [Root.Religion.GetName] ruler willing to pay for their upkeep. Being a religious order, they will only fight against heretics and infidels.",
    "EVTDESC_SOA_1709": "The Knights of Saint Anthony come from one of the oldest chivalric orders in the world. In 370, disciples of Anthony the Hermit founded the Order of Saint Anthony under the patronage of the Emperor of Ethiopia.\\n\\nAlthough they have kept a low profile for many centuries, this holy order has now resurfaced as a powerful force. Their stated purpose is to protect [Root.Religion.GetName] Christians from all those who would seek them harm, and to purge the land of infidels and heretics wherever they may be found.",
    "EVTDESC_SOA_1809": "Some of Persia's finest warriors have taken it upon themselves to found a new holy order dedicated to safeguarding the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. They call themselves the Immortals, just like the ancient Persian warrior elite described by Herodotus, and they seem intent on carrying on the martial traditions of their legendary predecessors.\\n\\nThis militant holy order has sworn to fight against all who would threaten the legacy of Zoroaster, and to never again allow Zoroastrianism to suffer the reverses it did in the wake of the Arab conquests of the 7th century.",
    "EVTDESC_SOA_1209": "A Sufi sect of dervishes has arisen under the leadership of a certain Hadji Baktash Wali, a mystic from Khorasan. Striving for 'Unity of Being', Bektashis train the soul through meditation and contemplation of the inner meaning of the Koran. The Bektashi Order is warlike and especially popular among [Root.Religion.GetName] Muslim soldiers. The Order has sworn to protect Islam and to combat infidels and polytheists of all kinds.",
    "EVTDESC88000": "Word is spreading that a [Root.Religion.GetName] missionary, Hassan-i Sabbah, has founded a religious order known as the 'Hashshashin' somewhere in western Persia. Using trickery and guile, this mysterious cult of trained killers has seized control of the mountain fortress of Alamut and converted it into their headquarters. Already a string of violent murders can be traced back to Hassan's devoted and fearless disciples...",
