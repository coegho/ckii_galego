The way he looked at me, disgust mixed with fear, could only mean he did not recognize me. I had to threaten to kill him to make him let go of the purse, and I made a silent vow to try and compensate him should I be able to ever return to my castle. His purse was heavy and so was my heart as I returned to the bandit leader.",

They grumbled a bit but was silenced by the leader who thought it to be an excellent idea. As we walked down the road, we saw a man clad in horse-skin leaning against a tree. I wanted to confront the horse-man myself but the stubborn leader did not listen. While he talked to horse-man, I was attacked and tied to a tree by one of my own sheriffs! The leader of the Merry Men returned, saw me tied to the tree and killed my sheriff before he cut my ropes.",

I had great fun together with the outlaws and feel no need to try and change their ways, as long as their shenanigans do not affect me. They seemed rather harmless, content to hide in their forest and occasionally robbing someone who will not suffer from losing a little gold.",

    "EVTDESC10042": "The wedding between lady Marion and Robin was held in the forest, venison was served at the wedding feast but I let it slip, for now. The bridal couple had only eyes for each other and when the fat monk started playing a slow, beautiful song about love they joined hands and danced, still gazing into each other eyes. They did not even notice when the song turned faster and the rest of the dancers followed the rhythm, but continued dancing slowly until the stars started sparkling on the clear sky.",
