    "EVTDESC_TOG_007": "As is proper, Rome once more suffers at the just hands of warriors from the east.

    "EVTDESC_TOG_012": "The city of Prague has indeed become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as Mongol warriors move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted.

    "EVTDESC_TOG_016": "The White City has turned red as the Mongol armies seize Belgrade and massacre the inhabitants without exception.

    "EVTNAME_TOG_017": "The Fall of Baghdad",
    "EVTDESC_TOG_017": "The decadent city of Baghdad, supposedly one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the unstoppable Mongol armies after a siege.
