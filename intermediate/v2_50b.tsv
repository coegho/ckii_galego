EVTOPTA_ZE_13094	I should be more like [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_13094	Now, don't be hasty, [From.GetLordLady] [From.GetFirstName].
EVTOPTC_ZE_13094	But gold is so pretty!
EVTOPTD_ZE_13094	But they hate me!
EVTDESCA_ZE_13101	Thinking about things, I have concluded that everything in the world is not as the priests say it is.
EVTDESCB_ZE_13101	There are people I know that follow different traditions than those of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. I have spoken to them and asked them about it, and now it doesn't seem so strange to me.
EVTDESCC_ZE_13101	I spend a lot of time exploring and thinking about how things work..

EVTOPTA_ZE_13104	[From.GetSheHe] is right, I should calm down.
EVTOPTB_ZE_13104	But they are fools!
EVTOPTC_ZE_13104	Is [From.GetSheHe] not interested in the world at all?
EVTOPTD_ZE_13104	Too clever for [From.GetHerHim], maybe.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13111	As I grow older, I increasingly find that my faith is a true fountain of strength.
EVTDESCB_ZE_13111	The more I hear of the words of the wise [Root.GetMenWomen] of old, the more I want to be like them.

EVTOPTB_ZE_13112	What a lovely child!
idolizer_may_become_kind	Chance of [From.GetFirstName] becoming Kind.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13114	[From.GetTitledFirstName] seems to think that I should replace my reverence for [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] with love for my fellow man.
EVTDESCB_ZE_13114	I worship the memory of the wise [From.GetMenWomen] of old, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks that I should focus on loving the living around me instead.
EVTDESCC_ZE_13114	I easily adore the virtues of others, but [From.GetTitledFirstName] thinks I'm too passive and should should focus more on helping people, lest I grow weak.

mysterious_charm_desc	This character doesn't talk much, but there is something interesting about them...
EVTDESCA_ZE_12010	I have seen [affectionate_events_char_1.GetFirstName] looking at my new wooden toy animals.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12010	My nannies are away and as I roam around the grounds I come upon [affectionate_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstName]. [affectionate_events_char_1.GetSheHeCap] looks up and seems interested in conversation.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12010	As I am out playing by myself and taking a break to eat some bread I brought from the kitchens, I suddenly notice a young peasant child staring at me. [Root.GetSheHeCap] looks hungry.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12010	I could let [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim] play with them.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12010	Yes, I have nicer toys than [affectionate_events_char_1.GetHerHim].

EVTOPTF_ZE_12010	I'll leave before [Root.GetSheHe] tries to steal from me!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12010_TOOLTIP1	You do a good deed.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12010_TOOLTIP2	You do a good deed, but someone sees you...
EVTDESCA_ZE_12012	[From.GetFirstName] has much nicer toys than me, and [From.GetSheHe] asked me if I want to play with them.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12012	[From.GetFirstName] has really nice toys but [From.GetSheHe] won't share them with me.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12012	Young [From.GetTitledFirstName] just walked up to me today, striking up conversation. We ended up having a long talk, about a great many things.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12012	Young [From.GetTitledFirstName] just walked up to me today, and as I was about to greet [From.GetHerHim], [From.GetSheHe] just stuck [From.GetHerHis] tongue out and ran away...
EVTOPTA_ZE_12012	Yes, that would be nice!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12012	No, those toys are silly anyway!
EVTOPTC_ZE_12012	I hate [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12012	How nice!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12012	Begone, [GetRootFromInsult]!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12012	What a strange child.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12014	[From.GetFirstName] and me played all day with my toys.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12014	I talked for a long while with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] had many funny things to tell me and we had a really good time.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12014	You shared your bread with the peasant child, and then you played together for several hours before parting ways. [Root.GetSheHeCap] waved happily as [Root.GetSheHe] ran home.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12014	You shared your bread with the child and then you played together for a while, until your nannies came and angrily interrupted you. As your friend ran away, the nannies said they'd tell [Educator.GetTitledFirstName] that you had been bad.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12014	It's so nice to share with others!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12014	Let's play again soon!
EVTOPTC_ZE_12014	I want more friends like this!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12014	I'll come see you again tomorrow!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12014	This was fun!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12014	But [Root.GetSheHe] is my friend!
EVTDESCA_ZE_12016	[From.GetFirstName] let me play with [From.GetHerHis] toys all day and it was so much fun.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12016	I spoke at length with [From.GetFirstName] about a great many things. We laughed a lot, and it seems I have made a new friend.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12016	Let's play again sometime!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12016	What a nice child!
EVTDESCA_ZE_12020	I saw [timid_events_char_1.GetTitledFirstName] being chided publicly for stealing food from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle], but I know [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] was elsewhere at the time.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12020	[timid_events_char_1.GetFirstName] seems very nice. Maybe I should ask if [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] wants to play?
EVTDESCC_ZE_12020	There's a big dinner feast tonight with many prominent people invited, and it has been decided that I shall perform a song in praise of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] for the guests.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12020	No one would listen to me anyway...
EVTOPTB_ZE_12020	I must speak up for [timid_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTC_ZE_12020	I'll wait a little, [timid_events_char_1.GetSheHe] could come to me...
EVTOPTD_ZE_12020	Yes, we should play!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020	No way!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12020	Yes, I will sing.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020_TOOLTIP1	Guests are amused.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12020_TOOLTIP2	Guests are offended.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12022	I was wrongfully accused of stealing fine foods from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]. I also know that young [From.GetFirstName] can confirm I was elsewhere when it happened, but [From.GetSheHe] has refused to step forward and confirm my innocence.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12022	I was strangely and wrongfully accused of stealing fine foods from the personal stores of the [Root.Liege.GetTitle]. However, young [From.GetFirstName] stepped forward to confirm that I was elsewhere at the time and so the suspicions against me were lifted.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12022	[From.GetFirstName] seems to be checking me out, but doesn't come over and talk.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12022	[From.GetFirstName] came over to me and said [From.GetSheHe] wanted us to be friends!
EVTOPTA_ZE_12022	The little wretch!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12022	Alas, I cannot blame the child for being timid.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12022	All is good then!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12022	I'll go and talk to [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12022	What's [From.GetSheHe] staring at? It's annoying!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12022	How nice!
EVTDESCA_ZE_12024	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is very angry with me for not speaking up in [From.GetHerHis] defence.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12024	[From.GetFirstName] came over and talked to me, asking if I wanted to be friends.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12024	A roar of laughter rolled through the hall when the guests were told that I had hid in a chest in order to avoid having to sing for them. Several of them then called me over and offered me food and candies.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12024	The guests were all very offended at my refusal to sing for them.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12024	What? It's not my problem!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12024	I should step forward now, it's not too late!
EVTOPTC_ZE_12024	Umm... no, I have to go.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12024	Yes, let's play!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12024	Oh yes!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12024	I don't care.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12026	Since [From.GetFirstName] refused to defend me, many people think I'm a thief and I have lost prestige at court.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12026	[From.GetFirstName] eventually stepped forward to defend my honor.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12026	I shall remember this.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12026	I can tell it took courage to speak up.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12030	[rowdy_events_char_1.GetFirstName] is always so annoying. I think [rowdy_events_char_1.GetSheHe] tries to win against me in games just to spite me!
EVTDESCB_ZE_12030	There are so many fun things to do, so many forbidden things. I wonder if [rowdy_events_char_1.GetFirstName] would like to join me in some fun pranks?
EVTOPTA_ZE_12030	I'll tell [rowdy_events_char_1.GetHerHim] to stop!
EVTOPTA_ZE_12030_TOOLTIP1	The matter escalates...\n
EVTOPTB_ZE_12030	It doesn't matter, [rowdy_events_char_1.GetSheHe] can win.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12030	I'll ask [rowdy_events_char_1.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12030	Or maybe we should just play dice instead.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12032	[From.GetFirstName] is angry with me because I am always winning against [rowdy_events_char_1.GetHerHim] in games.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12032	[From.GetFirstName] seems content to let me win when we play games.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12032	[From.GetFirstName] excitedly asks me if I wanted to come along and to forbidden things, pranks and the like.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12032	[From.GetFirstName] asks me if I wanted to play dice.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12032	I'll tell [From.GetHerHim] to get lost!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12032	I'll just avoid [From.GetHerHim] from now on.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12032	That's all fine then.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12032	Yes!
EVTOPTE_ZE_12032	No, I'm a good [Root.GetBoyGirl].
EVTOPTF_ZE_12032	Sounds like fun!
EVTDESCA_ZE_12034	[From.GetFirstName] got angry and told me to get lost!
EVTDESCB_ZE_12034	[From.GetFirstName] joined me and we did all kinds of pranks and tricks, everything except summoning [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]!
EVTDESCB2_ZE_12034	[From.GetFirstName] didn't want to play.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12034	What a shame.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12034	Fist fiiiiight!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12034	I'll walk away, it's not worth it.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12034	We should do this every day!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12034	That was fun, now let's play dice.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12036	[From.GetFirstName] went crazy and started a fist fight with me!
EVTDESCB_ZE_12036	Me and [From.GetFirstName] did all kinds of crazy and forbidden things. It was fun!
EVTOPTA_ZE_12036	Come on then, you [GetRootFromInsult]!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12036	Let's do it again sometime!

EVTDESC_ZE_12220	Languishing in my dungeon, one night I suddenly wake up with a cold feeling of apprehension. As I stare into the darkness, a hissing, evil voice speaks to me: 'I am the Dread King of Darkness. This dungeon is my realm, and I demand that you serve me.'.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12220	Yes, I will serve you!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12220	Never!
EVTDESC_ZE_12221	Late one night, the Dread King of Darkness appears to me again: 'Servant! You must find me the three dark stones of sorcery. They have been stolen from me and hidden in this dungeon. Know that I do not abide failure!'
EVTOPTA_ZE_12221	I will use force to find them!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12221	I shall use my cunning!
EVTDESC_ZE_12222	Eventually, I managed to recover the three dark stones of sorcery for the Dread King of Darkness. They only look like three ordinary little stones, but surely the King will be pleased.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12222	I am a hero, his most valuable servant!
EVTDESC_ZE_12223	I never managed to recover the three dark stones of sorcery. I now fear that the Dread King of Darkness will come and punish me for my failure.

EVTDESC_ZE_12225	My war with the Dread King of Darkness has begun. Every night he sends his legions of ghosts and shadows to assault me.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12225	I must strike back with all my power!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12225	I must evade, dodge and use my cunning!
EVTDESC_ZE_12226	In my valiant nightly battles against the Dread King of Darkness, I have finally reached the tipping point and forced my enemy to his knees.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12226	I rule in this dungeon!
EVTDESC_ZE_12227	I am exhausted from my nightly battles with the Dread King of Darkness, yet he is steadily advancing against me. It seems that the time for surrender has come.

EVTDESC_ZE_2100	I've gotten an increased amount of questions from [target_child.GetFirstName] lately about [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] and the rituals of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.

EVTOPTB_ZE_2100	It will be better for [target_child.GetHerHim] not to know.
EVTDESC_ZE_2101	Over the past weeks I've grown more and more curious about the beliefs and rituals of my [GetFromRelation]. Today [From.GetSheHe] finally began to answer my repeated questions about [From.Religion.GetHighGodName].
EVTOPTA_ZE_2101	Glory to [From.Religion.GetHighGodName]!
EVTOPTB_ZE_2101	What repugnant ideas!
EVTDESC_ZE_2102	Your [GetFromRelation], [From.GetFirstName] has, through the teachings of [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], been studying the principles of the [FromFrom.Religion.GetName] faith
EVTOPTA_ZE_2102	Interesting.
EVTDESC_ZE_2120	During the past few months, [target_child.GetFirstName] has shown dogged determination in [target_child.GetHerHis] studies of our language and has now also expressed a desire to study the history of my people's ancestors.
EVTOPTA_ZE_2120	I should encourage it.
EVTOPTB_ZE_2120	Make sure [target_child.GetSheHe] learns about [target_child.GetHerHis] own customs.
EVTDESC_ZE_2121	Pleased with the progress I'm making with learning the local language, [From.GetFirstName] has brought me a book about the ancestry of the [From.Culture.GetName] people.
EVTOPTA_ZE_2121	How fascinating.
EVTOPTB_ZE_2121	I'd rather study my own family's heritage.
EVTDESC_ZE_2122	Rumor has it that your [GetFromRelation] [From.GetFirstName] has been influenced by [From.GetHerHis] guardian's splendor. It is said that [From.GetFirstName] is now considered properly [From.Culture.GetName].
EVTOPTA_ZE_2122	I hope it's a beneficial influence.

EVTOPTD_ZE_12084	I can spend time reading.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12084	The grownups are happy.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12084	I feel terrible.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12084	Next time I will take my things with me.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12086	[From.GetFirstName] is quietly cleaning [From.GetHerHis] chambers after my episode in there. Seems like this is a very thorough child.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12086	[From.GetFirstName] was very upset with me and told everyone what I did.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12086	Maybe I shouldn't have.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12086	That little monster.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12090	It's bedtime but I can't find my favorite toy. I have it when I go to sleep.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12090	Food is on my plate, but steam is coming out of it. I wonder if it's safe to eat? [fussy_events_char_2.GetTitledName] is looking at me.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12090	I was invited to the servants' quarters to eat cake with them tonight. But just as I was going there, it started raining.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12090	I can't sleep without it!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12090	I'm a big [Root.GetBoyGirl] now.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12090	It's too hot.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12090	I should trust [fussy_events_char_2.GetFirstName].
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090	I can make it if I run.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12090	I don't want to get wet, I'll wait.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP1	Make it with no effort
EVTOPTE_ZE_12090_TOOLTIP2	Out in the cold too long
EVTDESCA_ZE_12092	[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy is missing and [From.GetSheHe] won't go to bed without it. I may have thrown it out today when I was tidying up.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12092	[From.GetFirstName] was a bit worried about not finding [From.GetHerHis] favorite toy, but seems to have settled down and is now sound asleep. 
EVTDESCC_ZE_12092	At the table today, [From.GetFirstName] complained about the food being too hot without even touching it.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12092	[From.GetFirstName] was very happy at dinner today, eating with great appetite.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12092	I'll offer to buy a new one.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12092	Guess I have to go find it.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12092	One more step towards growing up.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12092	Touch the food to make sure.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12092	Let [From.GetHerHim] wait.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12092	That's nice.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12094	[From.GetFirstName] offered to get me a new toy. [From.GetSheHeCap] said we could go find something nice tomorrow.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12094	[From.GetFirstName] finally found my toy after looking for it everywhere. It was in the trash.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12094	[From.GetFirstName] reached over the table and touched my food with [From.GetHerHis] whole hand. [From.GetSheHeCap] said it was not too hot to eat.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12094	[From.GetFirstName] seemed angry with me and told me to wait until I felt the food's temperature was just right. Now its cool enough.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12094	I ran very fast and I made it in time. We had lots of fun and the servants seem to like me.
EVTDESCF_ZE_12094	I made it to the servants' quarters, but I got very wet. Then we had a good time and they felt sorry for me having to go out in the cold..
EVTOPTA_ZE_12094	It's not the same, I want my toy!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12094	Ok then.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12094	It stinks!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12094	Oh I thought I had lost it.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12094	But now [From.GetSheHe] touched it.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12094	I guess it's fine.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12094	But now some of it is too cold.
EVTOPTH_ZE_12094	Alright, I'll eat the cold food.
EVTOPTI_ZE_12094	Yum yum.
EVTOPTJ_ZE_12094	I don't feel so good.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12096	My offer to purchase a new toy was rejected by [From.GetFirstName]. [From.GetSheHeCap] is upset I would even suggest such a thing.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12096	[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get a new toy the next day and finally settled down.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12096	I found the toy [From.GetFirstName] was crying about after going through the trash. But now [From.GetSheHe] is not satisfied because it smells.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12096	[From.GetFirstName] finally fell asleep after I found [From.GetHerHis] toy.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12096	No matter what I do or avoid doing, there seems to be no good way to make [From.GetFirstName] relax. [From.GetSheHeCap] won't eat at all now and I have no more energy to deal with it.
EVTDESCF_ZE_12096	[From.GetFirstName] finally decided to eat [From.GetHerHis] food.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12096	There is no pleasing this child.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12096	What a relief.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12096	It stinks!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12096	Oh I thought I had lost it.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12096	Hopeless.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12096	Peace at last.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12110	[idolizer_events_char_1.GetTitledName] is so kind to me. And [idolizer_events_char_1.GetSheHe] seems to know so much about everything.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12110	Spending time with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is great. We get along so well. Even when we do chores together time goes by so fast.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12110	I have been praying with the [Root.Religion.GetPriestTitle] for a while and some of the other people in the temple are getting ready to leave.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12110	I'll write [idolizer_events_char_1.GetHerHim] a song!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12110	I should tell the courtiers that I like it here.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12110	Everything is better when [idolizer_events_char_2.GetSheHe] is around.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12110	I will stay friends with [idolizer_events_char_2.GetHerHim] forever.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12110	[Root.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] will notice my dedication.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12110	I can collect alms to keep for myself.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12112	[From.GetFirstName] has written a song in my honor. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] wants me to know that I'm the best person in the world.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12112	[From.GetFirstName] told me that everyone is so kind here. [From.GetSheHeCap] would make sure everyone knew how grateful [From.GetSheHe] is.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12112	[From.GetFirstName] tells me that [From.GetSheHe] really loves spending time with me. I make [From.GetHerHis] days so much better.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12112	[From.GetFirstName] and I always get along well and now [From.GetSheHe] told me that we should stay friends forever.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12112	I can tell stories to impress [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12112	I'm just a responsible adult.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12112	[From.GetSheHeCap] is a joy to have around.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12112	I'll kiss [From.GetFirstName] on the cheek.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12112	[From.GetSheHeCap] is kind. But I don't feel that way.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12112	I can always count on [From.GetFirstName].
EVTDESCA_ZE_12114	[From.GetFirstName] was very happy for my gesture. [From.GetSheHeCap] agreed that [From.GetHerHis] exceptional personality and skill is worthy of songs and praise. Now the others could see [From.GetHerHim] for what [From.GetSheHe] is.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12114	[From.GetFirstName] was humbled by the song I had written. But [From.GetSheHeCap] wanted to make a point of being just an ordinary person, and that I shouldn't give [From.GetHerHim] more credit than [From.GetSheHe] deserves.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12114	[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12114	[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12114	After a whole night of religious ritual, I started getting hungry and my mind wandered. Maybe [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] is happy with the time I spent here.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12114	I wish [From.GetSheHe] was my [From.GetFatherMother].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12114	What a dufus.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12114	What a hero.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12114	Grownups can do anything.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12114	[From.GetSheHeCap] is the best.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12114	This is not what I meant.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12114	I shouldn't have said anything.
EVTOPTH_ZE_12114	I am being tested, I must stay here.
EVTOPTI_ZE_12114	I can't miss fencing practice.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12116	[From.GetFirstName] is no less impressed by me now. It seems I'm quite the idol for [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCB_ZE_12116	[From.GetFirstName] seems to have lost [From.GetHerHis] overwhelming affection for me. For better or worse, it's good to learn moderation. I might not be that special after all.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12116	[From.GetFirstName] said that I'm also wonderful to be around. Then [From.GetSheHe] gave me a kiss on the cheek and ran away.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12116	[From.GetFirstName] seemed a bit uneasy when I told [From.GetHerHim] how I felt. [From.GetSheHeCap] said that it was a nice thing to say, but maybe we should spend less time together.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12116	I hope I'm a good influence on [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12116	The older they get...
EVTOPTC_ZE_12116	What a sweetie.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12116	I don't like [From.GetHerHim] anyway...

EVTDESCA_ZE_12070	It has been a long day outside and [playful_events_char_1.GetTitledName] says it is time to head back home. [playful_events_char_1.GetSheHeCap] is carrying some heavy bags, maybe this time I can beat [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCB_ZE_12070	It's late at night and I get out of bed to use the chamberpot. [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] starts calling my name and I see a man hiding under the dining table. He notices me and whispers 'psst, come over here'. 
EVTDESCC_ZE_12070	Today I had to help out digging in the garden, but gardening is boring. The gardener is boring too, but maybe?
EVTOPTA_ZE_12070	Race me!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12070	Help [playful_events_char_1.GetHerHim] with the bags.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12070	Hide with the man.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12070	Answer [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName].
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070	I can tickle her.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12070	Hard work is good for discipline.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP1	Gardener is tickly.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12070_TOOLTIP2	Gardener doesn't appreciate tickling.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12072	After I told [From.GetFirstName] it was time to head on home, [From.GetSheHe] looked at me with a grin on [From.GetHerHis] face and told me to race [From.GetHerHim] home, leaving me to carry everything on my own.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12072	After some hours running errands I was heading back home with [From.GetFirstName]. Just as I told [From.GetHerHim] we were going home [From.GetSheHe] took one of the bags to help carry it without me even asking.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12072	[playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] stops calling for me after a while. The man says 'I bet you this gold coin you can't hold your breath until I'm outside'.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12072	[From.GetFirstName] was not in [From.GetHerHis] his room and I was starting to get worried. When [From.GetSheHe] finally answered I found [From.GetHerHim] staring at a burglar who was trying to hide from me.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12072	Race [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12072	Lecture [From.GetHerHim] about responsibilities.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12072	Bless the child.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12072	Easy money.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12072	Call for [playful_events_char_2.GetFirstName].
EVTOPTF_ZE_12072	Guards!
EVTDESCA_ZE_12074	[From.GetFirstName] chased and caught me. Maybe next time I can run fast enough.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12074	[From.GetFirstName] was not happy that I ran away from [From.GetHerHim] without helping. Now I have to stay indoors all day tomorrow.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12074	Before I knew it, the man was running out through the door. He didn't even look back once.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12074	[From.GetFirstName] seemed shocked when [From.GetSheHe] found me. The guards came and took the man hiding under the table. They said he was a bad man and I should stay away from strangers.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12074	We had some time to play before we finished all of the work.
EVTDESCF_ZE_12074	She was not ticklish, and now she is telling everybody what a hassle I am to have around.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12074	[From.GetSheHeCap] is so fast.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12074	[From.GetFirstName] is a cheater.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12074	Everyone here is so boring.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12074	I win, easy.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12074	I wonder who that was.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12074	Nothing has to be boring.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12074	She is stupid.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12076	[From.GetFirstName] never seems to be grumpy, always playing without a care in the world.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12076	[From.GetFirstName] was a little bit let down that I caught up with [From.GetHerHim] and even called me a cheater. Not always winning is a good thing for children to learn.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12076	I heard noises in the middle of the night and when I got up to check on [From.GetFirstName] I had to call out several times. Then [From.GetSheHe] finally answered and I found [From.GetHerHim] under the dining table with a burglar. The guards made quick work of the burglar.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12076	It will change.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12076	[From.GetSheHeCap] will thank me later.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12076	Thank [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] I found [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCA_ZE_12060	[indolent_events_char_1.GetFirstName] has come to get my help, today we are going to cut down some trees. Very hard work [indolent_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12060	I've been asked to go fetch some supplies at the market but it's a long walk. [indolent_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is already going to get other things.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12060	I'm reading a poetry book in my room but the weather is so nice outside. There are some children playing in the sun.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12060	Ouch, my stomach hurts suddenly.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12060	I'll cut down the biggest one.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12060	Pay [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim] to get your groceries.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12060	Join up with [indolent_events_char_2.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTE_ZE_12060	Go see what they are doing.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12060	Keep on reading.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12062	As soon as I came to pick up [From.GetFirstName] to help me out cutting down some trees [From.GetSheHe] starts complaining. Apparently [From.GetSheHe] has a nasty stomach ache.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12062	Today me and [From.GetFirstName] spent some time outside cutting down trees, no complaints from the young [From.GetBoyGirl] and work was finished early.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12062	[From.GetFirstName] asked me to get some things for [From.GetHerHim] at the market as I am already going there. [From.GetSheHeCap] is even paying me
EVTDESCD_ZE_12062	[From.GetFirstName] came with me to the market today, we both had to go get some groceries and had time to talk a lot.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12062	Indolent brat, I'll show [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12062	Maybe there's something wrong with [From.GetHerHim]?
EVTOPTC_ZE_12062	Job well done.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12062	Very easy money.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12062	I refuse!
EVTOPTF_ZE_12062	[From.GetFirstName] is so kind.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12064	[From.GetFirstName] spanked me when I complained about my stomach ache. Then [From.GetSheHe] grabbed my arm and told me we were going outside.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12064	[From.GetFirstName] seemed worried and brought me some tea. I have to drink it to get better. I also got some freshly baked bread for when I feel better.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12064	[From.GetFirstName] agreed to go get everything if I gave [From.GetHerHim] some extra coin. I should stay in my room so no one knows I'm still home. I've got some time to spend while I'm in here.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12064	[From.GetFirstName] didn't want to help me out. [From.GetSheHeCap] is already heading out.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12064	The other children are chasing each other, lots of running and jumping.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12064	Now I can't use my arm to cut trees.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12064	I'm coming, I'm coming!
EVTOPTC_ZE_12064	Oh tea and fresh bread!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12064	Maybe I should help [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTE_ZE_12064	I could use a nap right now.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12064	Read a book about money.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12064	I guess I'll have to go then.
EVTOPTH_ZE_12064	Maybe I'll just watch them.
EVTOPTI_ZE_12064	I'll join in.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12066	[From.GetFirstName] apparently has pains in [From.GetHerHis] arm now after I grabbed it and 'cannot use it to cut trees'.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12066	[From.GetFirstName] was happy when I brought [From.GetHerHim] some tea and bread. [From.GetSheHe] should recover soon.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12066	Some motivation can give good results, apparently the pain is all gone now after some convincing and [From.GetFirstName] will come join me.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12066	Hopeless...
EVTOPTB_ZE_12066	Poor child.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12066	Suddenly better, that's great.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12050	[brooding_events_char_1.GetTitledName] promised to take me riding today, but when I came to see [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim] [brooding_events_char_1.GetSheHe] was drunk and half asleep.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12050	'Try it again,' [brooding_events_char_2.GetFirstName] says. But I can't do it! I can't whistle.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12050	Everyone was busy at home, so I snuck out to the commoners market. When I got there some children were being mean to a smaller child in ragged clothes.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12050	Pour some water on [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_12050	Leave [brooding_events_char_1.GetHerHim] alone.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12050	How come you can do it?
EVTOPTD_ZE_12050	Keep trying.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12050	Stop them.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12050	Noone can know I'm here.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12052	Sure, I forgot about my promise to take [From.GetFirstName] riding. But now... Now [From.GetSheHe] poured water on me when I was resting. I only had a little bit to drink, and and and I am the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]!
EVTDESCB_ZE_12052	I woke up feeling a bit hung over, and it's already evening. I vaguely recall [From.GetFirstName] looking at me before I fell asleep. I think I had plans with [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCC_ZE_12052	[From.GetFirstName] wanted to learn to whistle. After trying for a while [From.GetSheHe] asked me 'How come you can do it?'
EVTDESCD_ZE_12052	[From.GetFirstName] asked me to teach [From.GetHerHim] how to whistle. I must have inspired [From.GetHerHim], now [From.GetSheHe] has been at it for hours.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12052	I'll show [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12052	I'm sorry [From.GetFirstName].
EVTOPTC_ZE_12052	I feel sick.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12052	It's easy, you can do it.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12052	Not everyone can do it.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12052	[From.GetSheHeCap]'ll get it right soon.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12054	[From.GetFirstName] tried to say something, but I couldn't hear what it was. Then [From.GetSheHeCap] got up and raised [From.GetHerHis] fist at me before stumbling and falling. Now [From.GetSheHe] is snoring.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12054	[From.GetFirstName] is quietly mumbling some words and rubbing [From.GetHerHis] face. 'Sorry, I'm sorry' [From.GetSheHe] says..
EVTDESCC_ZE_12054	[From.GetFirstName] told me that whistling is easy. That I can do it if I try. But I've tried many times already.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12054	[From.GetFirstName] said that not everyone learns to whistle. Some can never do it.
EVTDESCE_ZE_12054	The bullies all scatter when I tell them to stop. The small child looks at me and asks for food without mentioning the others and what they did. Is this how commoners live?
EVTOPTA_ZE_12054	My life will never be like this.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12054	Take some money while [From.GetSheHe] is sleeping.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12054	[From.GetFirstName] is not a grown up.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12054	Comfort [From.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTE_ZE_12054	Everyone can do it but me.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12054	I am good at other things.
EVTOPTG_ZE_12054	Donate some money for food and clothes.
EVTOPTH_ZE_12054	Tell child to ask their mom and dad.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12056	I have a bad headache, and my episode with [From.GetFirstName] is slowly coming back to me. There is no excuse for my behavior. What's worse is that I even got lectured by a child.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12056	Waking up in my room, I seem to be missing some money. I vaguely remember [From.GetFirstName] being here. Wasn't [From.GetSheHe]?
EVTDESCC_ZE_12056	The last thing I remember before falling asleep is apologizing to [From.GetFirstName]. It seems my apology was not what [From.GetSheHe] wanted.
EVTDESCD_ZE_12056	I wake up, and [From.GetFirstName] is still by my side. [From.GetSheHeCap] has brought me some water to drink, and covered me with a blanket. I don't deserve treatment like this. But if [From.GetSheHe] sees good in me...
EVTDESCE_ZE_12056	[From.GetFirstName] seems a bit frustrated by [From.GetHerHis] failed attempts. [From.GetSheHeCap] doesn't seem to respond well to my encouraging words.
EVTDESCF_ZE_12056	[From.GetFirstName] went back to [From.GetHerHis] room to do other things now.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12056	I have seen better days.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12056	That brat.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12056	I'm in a sad state.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12056	I can change. I will change.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12056	Many things seem to trouble this child.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12056	I'm glad [From.GetSheHe] doesn't dwell too much on these things.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12040	[willful_events_char_1.GetFirstName] is frowning at me. 'Waste of time. It will never fit, you've grown out of it.' [willful_events_char_1.GetSheHe] says. But it's my favorite hat!
EVTDESCB_ZE_12040	I'm out playing with [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] and we're close to the abandoned haunted house, we're not supposed to go there and [willful_events_char_2.GetFirstName] is looking frightened.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12040	I've been out fishing for hours. I still haven't caught a fish as big as that servant's child got yesterday.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12040	It will fit if you help me.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12040	Give the hat to someone younger.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12040	Go inside.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12040	Turn back.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040	If I wait long enough.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12040	Go home.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP1	Catch something.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12040_TOOLTIP2	Waste time.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12042	[From.GetFirstName] insists that I help [From.GetHerHim] get an old hat to fit. A very futile task as [From.GetSheHe]'s too big for it now as I've already told [From.GetHerHim] several times.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12042	[From.GetFirstName] really wants to go inside the scary haunted house. It looks like it's dangerous and we have been told not to go near it.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12042	No child tells me what to do.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12042	Give in to demands.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12042	I don't want to go in there.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12042	I can do this.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12044	[From.GetFirstName] hit me over the head for not listening to [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCB_ZE_12044	[From.GetFirstName] says we have to go back now, and if we don't [From.GetSheHe] will tell on me.
EVTDESCC_ZE_12044	After a few more hours, I finally feel something bite. It's a huge fish, probably the biggest fish in [Root.Capital.GetName].
EVTDESCD_ZE_12044	I'm just about to give up, but then it happened. I caught a fish, but it's not very big.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12044	[From.GetSheHeCap]'s a meanie!
EVTOPTB_ZE_12044	Someone else can make it fit.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12044	Come, or I'll say it was your idea.
EVTOPTD_ZE_12044	You're right.
EVTOPTE_ZE_12044	They will tell stories of today.
EVTOPTF_ZE_12044	At least I tried.
EVTDESCA_ZE_12046	[From.GetFirstName] thinks I'm mean for not helping. [From.GetSheHeCap] even stuck [From.GetHerHis] tongue out at me.
EVTDESCB_ZE_12046	[From.GetFirstName] says [From.GetSheHe] will get someone else to help [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCC_ZE_12046	[From.GetFirstName] still wants to go, and will lie and say it was my idea unless I go with [From.GetHerHim].
EVTDESCD_ZE_12046	[From.GetFirstName] said I was right and we went back home, away from the scary house.
EVTOPTA_ZE_12046	Well [From.GetSheHe]'s stupid.
EVTOPTB_ZE_12046	At least [From.GetSheHe] knows what [From.GetSheHe] wants.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12046	I'm so angry!
EVTOPTD_ZE_12046	Don't mess with [Root.GetFirstName].
EVTDESCA_ZE_13700	I wake up in the middle of the night, my heart racing and my whole body is feeling strange. What was I really dreaming about?
EVTOPTA_ZE_13700	That farmer [Root.GetBoyGirl] I met earlier.
EVTOPTB_ZE_13700	[lustful_target.GetFirstName], kissing me.
EVTOPTC_ZE_13700	Whatever it was is not important.
EVTOPTD_ZE_13700	I should just try to get to sleep.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13701	Oh it's just something about [Root.GetHerHim] that I can't get off my mind. [Root.GetHerHisCap] hair, the way [Root.GetSheHe] moved. I'm getting all worked up just thinking about [Root.GetHerHim] again.
EVTOPTA_ZE_13701	What would it be like to hold [Root.GetHerHim]?
EVTOPTB_ZE_13701	[Root.GetSheHeCap] is the one for me.
EVTOPTC_ZE_13701	If I see [Root.GetHerHim] again we'll have some fun.
EVTOPTD_ZE_13701	I shouldn't. It's a sin.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13702	[lustful_target.GetHerHisCap] lips touching mine. My hands, touching [lustful_target.GetHerHim] gently. I wonder if [lustful_target.GetFirstName] feels the same way about me?
EVTOPTA_ZE_13702	I will save myself for [lustful_target.GetHerHim].
EVTOPTB_ZE_13702	[lustful_target.GetSheHeCap] gets me all excited.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13703	These kind of thoughts have been distracting me lately. I don't find them very interesting and they are disturbing my sleep.
EVTOPTA_ZE_13703	I would do well to focus on other things.
EVTOPTB_ZE_13703	Maybe it will change with time.
EVTDESCA_ZE_13704	[From.GetFirstName] has been looking at me in a new way lately. Giggling whenever I talk to [From.GetHerHim], laughing at things that are not meant to be funny.
EVTOPTA_ZE_13704	It seems as [From.GetSheHe] is infatuated with me...
EVTOPTD63041	In exchange for a favor.
EVTOPTC_ZE_12060_TOOLTIP	May not take the offer.\n
EVTDESC20134	My liege, my work in [FromFrom.Location.GetName] seem to have come to fruition.
