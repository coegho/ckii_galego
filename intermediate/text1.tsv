DYN2_DESC	With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House von Habsburg. On the face of it, things were not looking very good for the Habsburg family in 1066. As minor Swiss counts, their status inside the Empire was fairly negligible compared to great territorial magnates of 11th century Germany. A policy of tactical marriages saw the family lands expand steadily, and it was during the chaos that gripped the Empire in the late 13h and early 14th century that the family were elected to the office of Holy Roman Empire. Although unable to hold the office they were able to use this a springboard to secure the Duchy of Austria for the dynasty. With this power base, the family would go on to dominate the politics of Central Europe until 1918.

The policy of dividing lands between heirs led to the state fragmenting and the various family groups would feud with each other. This left them too divided to cope with the 13th century Mongol invasion. The great principalities fell one by one to Batu, the grandson of Genghis Khan, and were forced to pay tribute to the victorious Mongols. The family itself survived and would rise again...

DYN6_DESC	With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Komnenos. If we exclude Isaac, who had launched a successful coup to become Emperor in 1057, the Komnenos family were loyal servants of the Byzantine Empire. In the chaos following the Seljuk victory at Manzikert, the Komnenos family followed that proud family tradition and launched another coup. For the next 100 years the dynasty would halt the decline of the Byzantine Empire under what we know as the Komnenian restoration. Ironically, the family would be toppled in a palace coup, but they would continue to rule as Emperors in Trebizond	With a score of $SCORE$ you$FAILED$ beat House Piast.

Control of two of the most powerful duchies in Germany and substantial lands in Italy made them the second most powerful family in Germany after the Hohenstaufen. One member of the Welf family would even gain the title of Emperor, but in the struggles would also weaken the family and much of the lands would be lost.

The family reached the height of its power through his son Simon de Montfort the Younger, who became de facto ruler of England.

EVTDESC69002	A note left on my table by an unseen visitor told me that if I did not deliver fifty gold within one hour to [From.GetTitledFirstName], my secret would be a secret no more. A small post scriptum wrote: 'the secret is that you are a sodomite'.	Ask him if he really desire men rather than women
EVTOPTA69002	I cannot let anyone believe that!	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is confronted by [Root.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTOPTB69002	No one will believe that!	I should tell others about my suspicion!

EVTOPTA69007	I don't know what to know anymore!	Yes, I am a sodomite
EVTDESC69010	The affection a courtier shows his sister is unnatural. I have begun to suspect they might be having a incestuous affair!	I need to prove to everyone who thinks I prefer men over women that I am not a sodomite!

EVTOPTA69012	Your silence is very valuable to me	I have to tell everyone about their incestuous affair!
EVTOPTB69012	You cannot prove anything!	I wonder how much my silence is worth to him...
EVTDESC69013	I did not know [From.GetTitledFirstName] could be so charming, and I had never really noticed how handsome [From.GetSheHe] is...	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is forced to pay for [Root.GetTitledFirstName] silence
EVTOPTA69013	Well, I wouldn't kick [From.GetHerHim] out of my bed...	When [From.GetTitledFirstName] started implying that I and my sister had an incestuous affair I could do nothing but deny, deny and deny.

EVTOPTB69013	Charming and handsome won't buy your way to my bed!	I love my sister, but not in that way!
EVTDESC69015	The rumors about my supposed incestuous love affair with my sister has reached the ears of my confessor.	I will prove I am not having an affair with my sister!

EVTTOOLTIP69017	The child has a too big mouth for its own safety...	Well, I wouldn't kick [From.GetHerHim] out of my bed...
EVTDESC69017	I should have killed the child when I had the chance! The child told everyone about me and my sister in the tower, describing in detail what it had seen...	Charming and handsome won't buy your way to my bed!
EVTOPTA69017	I fear the Holy Father will not look kindly upon us...	The rumors about my supposed incestuous love affair with my sister has reached the ears of my confessor.
EVTDESC69020	Everyone knows how deep and passionate the love between one of the courtiers and his wife are, but sadly it has not resulted in any children. I have heard the wife asking the other wives about cures and ways to get with child but to no avail.	I have sinned, if not in flesh then in mind...
EVTOPTA69020	Might he be impotent? I have to know!	I have nothing to confess, nothing to be forgiven for...

EVTOPTB69021	It's true, I'm impotent...	Everyone knows how deep and passionate the love between one of the courtiers and his wife are, but sadly it has not resulted in any children. I have heard the wife asking the other wives about cures and ways to get with child but to no avail.
EVTDESC69022	I would never have thought anyone would try to profit off our grief, our sorrow that we have failed to conceive a child. The demand for gold or the secret about our trouble conceiving would be out in the open made me furious.	Might he be impotent? I have to know!
EVTOPTA69022	[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] would be devastated, I have to pay...	[Root.GetTitledFirstName] ask [This.GetTitledFirstName] about his impotence
EVTOPTB69022	I will never give in to your demands!	It surprises me no one else knows this, I should tell them...

EVTTOOLTIP69032	[This.GetTitledFirstName] might decide to tell your wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]	It is my duty to confront him!
EVTDESC69032	When [From.GetTitledFirstName] denied that [From.GetSheHe] had committed adultery I was stunned, I had been so sure of what I had seen that it had never occurred to me that I might be wrong. I apologised and [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted the apology with a frown.	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is confronted about his adultery by [Root.GetTitledFirstName]

EVTTOOLTIP69033	 I should tell his wife [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] about his affair	I need a bit of persuasion if he wants me to stay silent...
EVTOPTB69032	Maybe I was wrong...	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is forced to pay [Root.GetTitledFirstName] for [Root.GetHerHis] silence
EVTDESC69033	When [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me about my husband [From.GetFirstName]'s little affair with some unknown women I was furious!

We hadn't been as discreet as we had hoped, [Root.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me about the adultery I had committed with the beautiful lady at the court.
EVTOPTA69033	You BASTARD!	I did not commit adultery with that woman

I apologised and [From.GetTitledFirstName] accepted the apology with a frown.
EVTDESC69034	The fury in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s eyes scared me nearly to death and when [From.GetSheHe] started screaming and cursing at me I wished I was dead.	I know what I saw!
EVTOPTA69034	I will never cheat on you again, I promise!	 I should tell his wife [From.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] about his affair
EVTDESC69035	[From.GetTitledFirstName] forgave me for my little indiscretion but I could see how much it had hurt her. I promised and swore that I would never commit adultery again, ever again.	Maybe I was wrong...
EVTOPTA69035	Trust me on this!	When [From.GetTitledFirstName] told me about my husband [From.GetFirstName]'s little affair with some unknown women I was furious! My rage had subsided a bit when I finally found my cheating husband, but as I saw him admiring the bosom of yet another clueless little strumpet the rage grew once again.
EVTDESC69036	[From.GetTitledFirstName] was direct: if I did not pay [From.GetHerHim] to keep quiet, [From.GetTitledFirstName] would make sure everyone in the court would know about my little affair with one of the court ladies.	You BASTARD!
EVTOPTA69036	Take this, I don't want to see you ever again!	[Root.GetTitledFirstName] is mad as hell at [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTOPTB69036	As if someone would believe you!	I should forgive and forget. I still love him

EVTOPTA69038	Why did you have to involve them?!	The fury in [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s eyes scared me nearly to death and when [From.GetSheHe] started screaming and cursing at me I wished I was dead.
EVTDESC69039	The voices could be heard through the walls and I recognized them as belonging to my wife and my mistress. My wife [Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName] tried to make my mistress break up with me, but she refused so I decided to step in...	I will never cheat on you again, I promise!
EVTOPTA69039	I reassure my mistress of my deep love for her	[From.GetTitledFirstName] forgave me for my little indiscretion but I could see how much it had hurt her. I promised and swore that I would never commit adultery again, ever again.
EVTOPTB69039	[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], you are the one I love!	Trust me on this!
EVTDESC69040	I knocked on the door and heard him swear when something was knocked to the floor and broke, by the sound of it. When he finally called 'Come in!' I opened the door and saw the messy room, filled with weird looking glasses, stuffed exotic animals and the man I was visiting in the middle of the mess with singed eyebrows.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] was direct: if I did not pay [From.GetHerHim] to keep quiet, [From.GetTitledFirstName] would make sure everyone in the court would know about my little affair with one of the court ladies.

EVTDESC69041	My latest experiment went a bit badly and I was trying to clean up the mess when someone knocked on the door. [From.GetTitledFirstName] entered and saw the mess I was standing in, with my singed eyebrows and the remains of my experiment spread all over the room. It didn't take long before [From.GetSheHe] accused me of dealing with the occult!	I reassure my mistress of my deep love for her
EVTOPTA69041	Are you mad? I would never!	[Root.Spouse.GetTitledFirstName], you are the one I love!
EVTOPTB69041	I cackled madly at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusation	I knocked on the door and heard him swear when something was knocked to the floor and broke, by the sound of it.

EVTDESC69045	The voice woke me up, whispering about spells to awaken the dead, curses to make your enemy go blind and potions to make anyone fall in love with you...	Are you mad? I would never!
EVTOPTA69045	I hope I can remember all of this!	I cackled madly at [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s accusation
EVTOPTB69045	I ignore the voice and go back to sleep	I could hardly believe my ears when [From.GetTitledFirstName] tried to pressure me into giving [From.GetHerHim] money to keep quiet about my dealings with the occult!
EVTDESC69046	My confessor talked sternly to me, clearly avoiding to bring up the occultist rumor but as I just nodded and accepted all he told me without admitting to anything, he lost his patience with me. He scolded me and told me to repent, to stop fiddling with the occult or else...	This is all I have got...

EVTDESC69055	It was not my fault the builders had used inferior materials for the building, nor that the locals managed to swindle us on most of the taxes. Still, my liege [From.GetTitledFirstName] aren't too happy with me as a Steward and I do not blame him.	I might be persuaded to let you keep your job...
EVTOPTA69055	I will shape up!	I know I have failed [From.GetTitledFirstName]'s expectations for what a Marshal should be able to do, but if only [From.GetSheHe] could give me a chance I would show [From.GetHerHim] that I do not lack in martial skill!

EVTOPTA69056	You can and must do better!	I sent Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] to oversee construction in a province - and the building fell apart almost instantly. Then I sent him to collect taxes in one of the richest provinces and [Root.job_treasurer.GetSheHe] returned with much less than I had anticipated.

EVTTOOLTIP75097	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is shown evidence that exculpate [Root.GetTitledFirstName]	[From.GetTitledFirstName] confronted me outside the tavern, me still counting the gold the thieves had given me in exchange for my cooperation. Instead of demanding my head or imprisoning me, [From.GetTitledFirstName] took the gold and told me to never associate with thieves ever again.
EVTTOOLTIP75098	[This.GetTitledFirstName] knows [Root.GetTitledFirstName] have stolen money	I promise, never again!
EVTOPTB75096	I admit it, I stole the money. But you pay me too little!	Steward [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName] probably did not think I'd notice if a few coins here and there went missing, but the steady disappearance made me suspicious. Might it be that the gold is disappearing into [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]'s greedy fingers?
EVTDESC75097	[From.GetTitledFirstName] declared that [From.GetSheHe] was innocent. Further investigation revealed that the cook, responsible for the purchase of food stuff, had forgotten to account for the extra eggs he had bought during the last month.	Question [Root.job_treasurer.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTOPTA75097	Now I know I can trust Steward [From.GetTitledFirstName]!	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is questioned by [Root.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTDESC75098	I found some more evidence Steward [From.GetTitledFirstName] had stolen the money and confronted [From.GetHerHim] with it. [From.GetSheHeCap] confessed and begged me to be just when punishing [From.GetHerHim].	I don't care
EVTOPTA75098	You shall pay back the money you stole, [From.GetTitledFirstName]	[From.GetTitledFirstName] accused me of stealing! Coins had gone missing and all current evidence points at me...
EVTOPTB75098	You shall rot in prison, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!	I would never steal!
EVTOPTC75098	You are forgiven, [From.GetTitledFirstName]	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is shown evidence that exculpate [Root.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTDESC75099	[From.GetTitledFirstName] fined me for stealing money and took all the money I had!	[This.GetTitledFirstName] knows [Root.GetTitledFirstName] have stolen money
EVTOPTA75099	That was harsh!	I admit it, I stole the money. But you pay me too little!
EVTDESC75100	[From.GetTitledFirstName] believed I had stolen the money and put me in prison to repent my crimes and my sins.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] declared that [From.GetSheHe] was innocent. Further investigation revealed that the cook, responsible for the purchase of food stuff, had forgotten to account for the extra eggs he had bought during the last month.
EVTOPTA75100	I repent, just let me out of here!	Now I know I can trust Steward [From.GetTitledFirstName]!
EVTDESC75105	A band of highway robbers has been roaming freely in one of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s counties. I am itching to do something about this situation, I should propose to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] that we should deal with it.	I found some more evidence Steward [From.GetTitledFirstName] had stolen the money and confronted [From.GetHerHim] with it. [From.GetSheHeCap] confessed and begged me to be just when punishing [From.GetHerHim].
EVTTOOLTIP75106	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is asked to assign some soldiers to deal with the highway robber band	You shall pay back the money you stole, [From.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTOPTA75105	Me and a bunch of soldiers could easily take them!	You shall rot in prison, [From.GetTitledFirstName]!
EVTOPTB75105	...or maybe I shouldn't put myself in danger...	You are forgiven, [From.GetTitledFirstName]
EVTDESC75106	The band of highway robbers has become more and more audacious, plundering more towns and settlements for everyday. Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] has proposed to lead an attack personally to eradicate them from the province.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] fined me for stealing money and took all the money I had!
EVTOPTA75106	Give [From.GetHerHim] more than enough soldiers	That was harsh!
EVTOPTB75106	Tell [From.GetHerHim] to bring [From.GetHerHis] own retinue only	[From.GetTitledFirstName] believed I had stolen the money and put me in prison to repent my crimes and my sins.
EVTOPTA75110	The girl is lying!	I repent, just let me out of here!
EVTTOOLTIP75111	[This.GetTitledFirstName] decides if [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is guilty or not	A band of highway robbers has been roaming freely in one of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s provinces. I am itching to do something about this situation, I should propose to [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName] that we should deal with it.
EVTOPTA75111	Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be fined for [From.GetHerHis] crime!	[This.GetTitledFirstName] is asked to assign some soldiers to deal with the highway robber band
EVTOPTB75111	Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be imprisoned	Me and a bunch of soldiers could easily take them!
EVTOPTC75111	I don't believe this. The daughter must be lying	...or maybe I shouldn't put myself in danger...
EVTTOOLTIP75114	[Root.GetTitledFirstName] "finds evidence" of [This.GetTitledFirstName]'s innocence	The band of highway robbers has become more and more audacious, plundering more towns and settlements for everyday. Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] has proposed to lead an attack personally to eradicate them from the province.
EVTOPTA75113	Let me out! I didn't hurt her!	Give [From.GetHerHim] more than enough soldiers
EVTDESC75120	Marshal [Root.job_marshal.GetTitledFirstName] told me about [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] ideas. I couldn't really understand what [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] was talking about, but [Root.job_marshal.GetSheHe] was adamant in [Root.job_marshal.GetHerHis] belief that this would improve the military.	Tell [From.GetHerHim] to bring [From.GetHerHis] own retinue only
EVTOPTA75120	Adopt the Marshal's ideas	One of [Root.Liege.GetTitledFirstName]'s vassals have accused me of raping his daughter!
EVTOPTB75120	It's not worth it	The girl is lying!
EVTDESC255	There are less cruel people who would say that my use of unnecessary violence is appalling. Then I would remind them that this is war and war means that there are no such thing as 'unnecessary violence'.	[This.GetTitledFirstName] decides if [Root.GetTitledFirstName] is guilty or not
EVTOPTA255	Especially when it is used against your enemies...	The father was very upset and I had to promise him I would look into the matter. His daughter had supposedly been raped by Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] and the father demanded the Marshal's head on a plate!
EVTDESC256	I interrupted Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] while [From.GetSheHe] was interrogating an prisoner to find out where our enemy would attack next. The soldier who brought me to [From.GetTitledFirstName] accused [From.GetHerHim] of using unnecessary violence and looked at me for support.	Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be fined for [From.GetHerHis] crime!
EVTOPTA256	That's the cruelty of war	Marshal [From.GetTitledFirstName] will be imprisoned
EVTOPTB256	I disapprove of [From.GetHerHis] conduct too	I don't believe this. The daughter must be lying

HINT_SPLASH_TIME	Crusader Kings II is a Pausable Real-Time game. This means that you can issue commands both while the game is paused and when the clock is running. To pause or unpause the game, click the date in the upper-right corner or press the Spacebar. Use the plus and minus symbols to speed time up or to slow it down.	Dinastía pequena
HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TITLE	The Character View	Save Deletion
#HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_2	The bottom half of the Character View is dedicated to close relations. Vassals are feudal lords in fief to the selected character. The Court tab lists the people at the court of the character. Allies are lords who can be called into wars, and the 'Abroad' tab lists courtiers who are currently away for some reason.	Are you sure you want to delete this save file? There is no way to bring it back once it is gone.
HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_3	Every character in the game has an opinion of every other character. The tooltip for the opinion explains the reasons in detail. Computer controlled characters will act in accordance with their opinions.	Tenda no xogo
HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_4	The Dynasty of the character is shown in the top right of the screen. A valid heir always has to be of your own Dynasty. You should strive to expand your dynasty and make sure members hold as many titles as possible.	Precisas iniciar sesión en Paradox Connect para usar a tenda no xogo
HINT_CHAR_VIEW_TEXT_5	Some portraits have little symbols on them. A star means it is the character you currently play, a crown signifies your heir, and a little drop means the character is of your dynasty.	Already bought
HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TITLE	The Council View	You need at least §Y$DUCATS_DIFF$§! more ducats to buy §Y$ITEM$§!
HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_1	Every ruler has a Council to help administer the realm. Each of the five positions on the Council has a primary attribute - Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue and Learning. The councillor's skill value is added to the ruler's for all matters of state.	No item selected. Select an item from the list to left.
HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_2	Councillors can be sent to a county on the map to perform various jobs. For example, the Court Chaplain can be dispatched to convert counties and the characters in them to your religion.	Click to buy §Y$ITEM$§! for §Y$DUCATS$§! ducats
HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_3	Characters will like you better for being entrusted with a position on the Council, but they will also resent being dismissed from it.	You have already bought §Y$ITEM$§!
#HINT_COUNCIL_VIEW_TEXT_4	Some characters dream of attaining a Council position. Granting them their wish will permanently increase their corresponding attribute by 1 (and make them extra grateful to you).	Do you wish to buy $ITEM$?
HINT_LAW_VIEW_TITLE	The Law View	Current balance: $BALANCE$ ducats\n$ITEM$: $COST$ ducats\nBalance after purchase: $REMAINING$ ducats
HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_1	This screen allows you to change the laws of your demesne. There are two main types of law - succession laws and regular laws. Succession laws determine who the rightful heir is, regular laws concern matters of governance.	Restart needed
HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_2	Succession laws are difficult to change because different succession laws completely alter the dynamic of the game. Different groups of people will tend to like or dislike different succession laws depending on how it affects their chances of succeeding.	Crusader Kings II needs to be restarted before bought DLC will take effect
HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_4	Kingdoms are also unique in that they have separate succession laws even if they are currently ruled by the same king. Therefore, united kingdoms might well split up and once more be ruled by two different characters when the old king dies.	Welcome to Crusader Kings II!
HINT_LAW_VIEW_TEXT_5	The characters who are currently second and third in the line of succession are called Pretenders. They will usually dislike the current heir and even the current ruler.	In Crusader Kings II, you play a feudal lord in medieval Europe. Your goal is to secure as much land and prestige as possible for yourself and, when the time comes, your successors. You can see your portrait in the upper-left corner. Click the portrait to find out who your character is.
HINT_TECH_VIEW_TITLE	The Technology View	As a new feudal lord, your first priority is to secure an heir. If you do not have a legitimate heir when your character dies, it's Game Over. Other pressing matters that need your attention will appear as Alerts along the top of the screen.
HINT_TECH_VIEW_TEXT_1	Technology was fairly static in medieval times. Nevertheless, certain advances were made over the centuries. In Crusader Kings II, every county on the map has separate levels of technology.	Crusader Kings II is a Pausable Real-Time game. This means that you can issue commands both while the game is paused and when the clock is running. To pause or unpause the game, click the date in the upper-right corner or press the Spacebar. Use the plus and minus symbols to speed time up or to slow it down.
HINT_TECH_VIEW_TEXT_3	While in the Technology View, hovering over a county on the map will show the advancement levels there rather than in your capital.	Unless your dynasty dies out or you lose your last piece of land, the game will end in 1452, and you can compare your success with that of other dynasties from real history.
HINT_MIL_VIEW_TITLE	The Military View	The Character View
HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_1	This screen gives you an overview of all your military assets and allows you to raise your levies and those of your vassals, either one by one or all at once.	The bottom half of the Character View is dedicated to close relations. Vassals are feudal lords in fief to the selected character. The Court tab lists the people at the court of the character. Allies are lords who can be called into wars, and the 'Abroad' tab lists courtiers who are currently away for some reason.
HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_2	The 'Vassals' tab lists all your direct vassals and their opinions of you. The less they like you, the smaller the part of their levies they will send when you raise them. Vassals will pay for the maintenance of their troops even when under your command. Therefore, vassals will dislike you more for every year you keep their levies raised.	Every character in the game has an opinion of every other character. The tooltip for the opinion explains the reasons in detail. Computer controlled characters will act in accordance with their opinions.
HINT_MIL_VIEW_TEXT_3	The 'Mercenaries' tab lists all available mercenary companies that you can hire. Mercenaries are professional soldiers who fight well as long as they are paid well, but if your coffers run empty they might decide to abandon you - or even defect to your enemies!	The Dynasty of the character is shown in the top right of the screen. A valid heir always has to be of your own Dynasty. You should strive to expand your dynasty and make sure members hold as many titles as possible.
HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TITLE	The Intrigue View	Some portraits have little symbols on them. A star means it is the character you currently play, a crown signifies your heir, and a little drop means the character is of your dynasty.
HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TEXT_3	Plots are a shady but effective way of achieving less innocuous goals. Unlike Ambitions, Plots require backers, co-conspirators, to succeed. The progress of a plot is measured by its Power, representing the collective influence and position of the plotters.	The Council View
HINT_PLOT_VIEW_TEXT_4	Your Spymaster will discover plots depending on his Intrigue skill (unless he himself is in on it!) Once you know of a plot, you can try to convince the plotter to end his or her scheming, or you can resort to other measures...	Every ruler has a Council to help administer the realm. Each of the five positions on the Council has a primary attribute - Diplomacy, Martial, Stewardship, Intrigue and Learning. The councillor's skill value is added to the ruler's for all matters of state.
#HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TITLE	The Diplomacy View	Councillors can be sent to a county on the map to perform various jobs. For example, the Court Chaplain can be dispatched to convert counties and the characters in them to your religion.
HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TEXT_1	This view lists all the actions you can take towards another character. Note that, unless a character is a ruler, it is usually their liege who actually responds to your proposals.	Characters will like you better for being entrusted with a position on the Council, but they will also resent being dismissed from it.
HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TEXT_2	When you have sent a proposal to a character, it will take them some time to respond. However, you can see their likely answer, and their reasoning, even before you send your proposal.	Some characters dream of attaining a Council position. Granting them their wish will permanently increase their corresponding attribute by 1 (and make them extra grateful to you).
HINT_DIPLO_VIEW_TEXT_3	In the tooltip for the target's acceptance, if the number of green plus signs (§G+§!) exceeds the number of red minus signs (§R-§!), the proposal will be accepted.	The Law View
HINT_REL_VIEW_TITLE	The Religious View	This screen allows you to change the laws of your demesne. There are two main types of law - succession laws and regular laws. Succession laws determine who the rightful heir is, regular laws concern matters of governance.
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_1	This view summarizes the state of your religion. Most religions have a formal head, like the Pope, the Caliph or the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Religions also have a 'Moral Authority' value, which affects how fast heresies spread and how easy it is to convert counties and characters to the religion.	Succession laws are difficult to change because different succession laws completely alter the dynamic of the game. Different groups of people will tend to like or dislike different succession laws depending on how it affects their chances of succeeding.
HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_2	The chief pontiff of a religion has various special abilities, like calling for a Holy War, or granting a divorce. If the moral authority of a religion is too low, these abilities are disabled. It is a good idea to have good relations with your chief pontiff in order to make use of his powers.	Kingdoms are also unique in that they have separate succession laws even if they are currently ruled by the same king. Therefore, united kingdoms might well split up and once more be ruled by two different characters when the old king dies.
#HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_3	The Catholic faith is a bit special since the Pope is considered God's representative on Earth. He has more powers than other religious heads, but there is a catch - many Bishops feel more loyal to him than to their secular liege, and will send their taxes to Rome. One way around this problem is to set up an Antipope - a puppet pope who will do what he's told.	The characters who are currently second and third in the line of succession are called Pretenders. They will usually dislike the current heir and even the current ruler.
#HINT_REL_VIEW_TEXT_4	Another way of ensuring friendly Bishops is to change the Kingdom law to Crown or Free Investiture Law and nominate loyalists to your bishoprics.	The Technology View
HINT_REALM_VIEW_TITLE	The Title View	Technology was fairly static in medieval times. Nevertheless, certain advances were made over the centuries. In Crusader Kings II, every county on the map has separate levels of technology.
HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_1	This upper part of this screen contains information about a landed title. Titles are organized into a tree-like structure with Empire tier titles on top and baronies at the bottom. There are both 'de facto' and 'de jure' trees, and you can toggle between them.	While in the Technology View, hovering over a county on the map will show the advancement levels there rather than in your capital.
HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_2	There are quick buttons to Create, Usurp, Claim or Revoke titles from this screen, if applicable. There is a also a button to display all living claimants to the title, and a button to show a list of previous holders.	The Military View
HINT_REALM_VIEW_TEXT_3	The lower part of the Title View shows information about the title holder's entire Demesne and its budget.	This screen gives you an overview of all your military assets and allows you to raise your levies and those of your vassals, either one by one or all at once.
HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TITLE	The Character Browser	The 'Vassals' tab lists all your direct vassals and their opinions of you. The less they like you, the smaller the part of their levies they will send when you raise them. Vassals will pay for the maintenance of their troops even when under your command. Therefore, vassals will dislike you more for every year you keep their levies raised.
HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TEXT_1	The Character Browser allows you to search for various categories of characters.	The 'Mercenaries' tab lists all available mercenary companies that you can hire. Mercenaries are professional soldiers who fight well as long as they are paid well, but if your coffers run empty they might decide to abandon you - or even defect to your enemies!
HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TEXT_2	'Search All' includes absolutely every character in the game, except dead ones.	The Intrigue View
HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TEXT_3	'Search Realm' includes all characters under your top liege.	Plots are a shady but effective way of achieving less innocuous goals. Unlike Ambitions, Plots require backers, co-conspirators, to succeed. The progress of a plot is measured by its Power, representing the collective influence and position of the plotters.
HINT_BROWSER_VIEW_TEXT_4	'Search Vassals' includes all characters under you.	Your Spymaster will discover plots depending on his Intrigue skill (unless he himself is in on it!) Once you know of a plot, you can try to convince the plotter to end his or her scheming, or you can resort to other measures...
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TITLE	The County View	The Diplomacy View
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_1	The map is divided into a number of Counties, each containing a number of landed Holdings - Castles, Cities and Temples. Counties are ruled by Counts, and holdings are ruled by Barons (or cultural equivalents.)	This view lists all the actions you can take towards another character. Note that, unless a character is a ruler, it is usually their liege who actually responds to your proposals.
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_2	The Holdings are the basis of the game's economy and military systems. Holdings provides tax income and a military levy. Castles have the best levies but the least tax. Cities are rich, but have poor levies. Temples are both rich and provide good levies, but are hard to defend.	When you have sent a proposal to a character, it will take them some time to respond. However, you can see their likely answer, and their reasoning, even before you send your proposal.
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_3	Counties have a religion and a culture, representing the broad population layers. The people of a county tend to dislike rulers of a foreign culture or religion, which can cause peasant uprisings.	In the tooltip for the target's acceptance, if the number of green plus signs (§G+§!) exceeds the number of red minus signs (§R-§!), the proposal will be accepted.
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_4	Counties also have different levels of technological advancement, which tend to spread from one county to its neighbors.	The Religious View
HINT_PROV_VIEW_TEXT_5	The capital Holding of a County is always held by the count. The other holdings can be held by anyone.	This view summarizes the state of your religion. Most religions have a formal head, like the Pope, the Caliph or the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. Religions also have a 'Moral Authority' value, which affects how fast heresies spread and how easy it is to convert counties and characters to the religion.
HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TITLE	The Holding View	The chief pontiff of a religion has various special abilities, like calling for a Holy War, or granting a divorce. If the moral authority of a religion is too low, these abilities are disabled. It is a good idea to have good relations with your chief pontiff in order to make use of his powers.
HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_1	This view shows details about a Holding and allows its owner to build various improvements.	The Catholic faith is a bit special since the Pope is considered God's representative on Earth. He has more powers than other religious heads, but there is a catch - many Bishops feel more loyal to him than to their secular liege, and will send their taxes to Rome. One way around this problem is to set up an Antipope - a puppet pope who will do what he's told.
HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_2	The collection of Holdings held by a single character is called a Demesne. You can cycle through the holdings in your demesne with the arrows.	Another way of ensuring friendly Bishops is to change the Kingdom law to Crown or Free Investiture Law and nominate loyalists to your bishoprics.
HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_3	Some buildings cannot be built until a certain technology exists in the county. Others might have another building as a prerequisite.	The Title View
HINT_HOLDING_VIEW_TEXT_4	The owner the Holding, or his liege and above, can change the name of the Holding by clicking the name and editing it.	This upper part of this screen contains information about a landed title. Titles are organized into a tree-like structure with Empire tier titles on top and baronies at the bottom. There are both 'de facto' and 'de jure' trees, and you can toggle between them.
HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TITLE	The Unit View	There are quick buttons to Create, Usurp, Claim or Revoke titles from this screen, if applicable. There is a also a button to display all living claimants to the title, and a button to show a list of previous holders.
HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_1	Units are collections of regiments or ships, which can be raised from Holdings or provided by Mercenaries or Holy Orders.	The lower part of the Title View shows information about the title holder's entire Demesne and its budget.
HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_2	Armies are organized into three parts - left flank, centre, and right flank. Each part is led by one of the regiment commanders. The commander of the Centre is considered commander of the whole army.	The Character Browser
HINT_UNIT_VIEW_TEXT_3	Armies take attrition losses in Counties that cannot supply them. Check the supply limit in the County View.	The Character Browser allows you to search for various categories of characters.
HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TITLE	The Combat View	'Search All' includes absolutely every character in the game, except dead ones.
HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_1	During combat, the three parts of both armies face off - left flank against right flank, centre against centre, and right flank against left.	'Search Realm' includes all characters under your top liege.
HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_2	Combat starts in Skirmish Phase, when archers and horse archers are paramount unit types. Eventually, the flanks will close with each other and enter Melee phase, where heavy infantry and knights shine. When a flank flees, its opponent will be in Pursue phase, trying to run down as many enemies as possible. Here, light cavalry is best.	'Search Vassals' includes all characters under you.
HINT_COMBAT_VIEW_TEXT_3	During each combat phase, flank commanders will pick a tactic depending on their Martial skill, which largely determines how effectively their troops fight.	The County View
HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TITLE	The Siege View	The map is divided into a number of Counties, each containing a number of landed Holdings - Castles, Cities and Temples. Counties are ruled by Counts, and holdings are ruled by Barons (or cultural equivalents.)
HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_1	The length of a Siege is mainly determined by the fort level of the Holding, the number of defenders and the number of besiegers.	The Holdings are the basis of the game's economy and military systems. Holdings provides tax income and a military levy. Castles have the best levies but the least tax. Cities are rich, but have poor levies. Temples are both rich and provide good levies, but are hard to defend.
HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_2	If the besiegers have fewer troops than the defenders, the siege will be ineffective.	Counties have a religion and a culture, representing the broad population layers. The people of a county tend to dislike rulers of a foreign culture or religion, which can cause peasant uprisings.
HINT_SIEGE_VIEW_TEXT_3	Siege ends when the morale of the defenders reaches zero (or the attackers leave or are driven off.)	Counties also have different levels of technological advancement, which tend to spread from one province to its neighbors.
HINT_CONFIRM_DISABLE_TITLE	Disable Hints?	The capital Holding of a County is always held by the count. The other holdings can be held by anyone.
HINT_CONFIRM_DISABALE_DESC	Do you wish to permanently disable hints?\n(You can reactivate hints from the Settings screen.)	The Holding View

I will go ahead and spread the rumor about [FromFrom.GetHerHis] corruption and destroy [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reputation among [FromFrom.GetHerHis] vassals.\n\nYour humble Spymaster,\n[From.GetTitledName]	My liege, it seems that [FromFrom.GetTitledName] does not care if I spread the rumor or not about his alleged homosexuality. But I think he will regret his choice once I have informed his vassals.\n\nYour humble Spymaster,\n[From.GetTitledName]
EVTOPTA20377	You have my blessing!	So do I
EVTDESC20378	My spymaster, [From.GetTitledName] has been murdered! That noble he was investigating, [FromFrom.GetTitledName], seems reasonable to be behind this, but I have no proof...	[From.GetTitledName] and [From.GetHerHis] spymaster went ahead and spread the rumors about me being a homosexual. Those of my vassals who did not like me before does not seem to like me better after this incident...
EVTOPTA20378	Damn him anyway!	A most unfortunate incident
EVTDESC20379	The rumors about me being corrupt is of course false, but I realize that you already know this and that I do not have much of a choice. So it is with regret that I have to 'confess' to this crime...	[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to get away...
EVTOPTA20379	This should satisfy my liege!	Damn [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!
#EVTDESC20369	My liege, [FromFrom.GetTitledName] decided to not risk upsetting his vassals and confessed to the allegations of corruption. It will take some time before [FromFrom.GetHerHis] prestige recovers and I have with me the fine I collected.\n\nYour humble Spymaster,\n[From.GetTitledName]	The men I sent to deal with [FromFrom.GetTitledName] succeeded. [From.GetSheHeCap] will not bother me again...
########################################		Corruption Uncovered
#MARSHAL EVENTS		My network of spies have encountered vague rumors that a local noble might be corrupt. Used wisely this might be enough to implicate one of my liege's enemies here in [Root.Location.GetName].
########################################		My liege will now what to do
EVTNAME938	Military Drill Accident	My liege, there is a rumor here in [From.Location.GetName] that one of the local nobles might be corrupt. Handled wisely this information might be used to implicate one of your enemies here.\n\nYour humble Spymaster,\n[From.GetTitledName]
EVTDESC938	I was skeptical about my visit to [Root.Location.GetName] to try and find some way to get into the thickheaded peasants how different sorts of military equipment should be best used. Of course they managed to fumble...	Than use it as you see fit
EVOPTA938	They wounded me!	It is just a rumor, let it be
EVOPTB938	They maimed me!	My liege's instructions are clear. I should use the rumor about corruption to try and implicate one of [From.GetHerHis] enemies here in [Root.Location.GetName].
EVTTOOLTIP20380	Send a letter to my liege	It will be my pleasure
EVTDESC20380	My liege, I was trying to teach the thickheaded peasants of [From.Location.GetName] how to use siege weapons when one of them dropped a boulder on my foot! I despair of ever teaching these idiots how to wage war...\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName]	My liege seems to have lost interest in this noble and wants me to forget the whole thing.
EVTOPTA20380	Oh dear...	As [From.GetSheHe] wish.
EVTDESC20381	My liege, I implore you to send me to another county! The nitwits of [From.Location.GetName] have already cost me one limb, I don't want to lose any more limbs just because they don't know the back from the front of an arrow!\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName]	[From.GetTitledName], the spymaster of [From.Liege.GetTitledName], has somehow connected a rumor about corruption here in [From.Location.GetName] with me. It seems they try to hurt my reputation with my vassals and wants me to confess.
EVTOPTA20381	How can I wage war with these peasants?!	Try to have [From.GetTitledName] killed!
EVTNAME939	Military Secrets Revealed	I guess I do not have a choice
EVTDESC939	I had traveled to [Root.Location.GetName] to try and help teach the population about the military equipment they have at their disposal, in case they would ever be besieged or if my liege would need to recruit soldiers from the province. But I feel I am getting nowhere...	[FromFrom.GetTitledName] managed to get away...
EVTOPTA939	If only something would go my way	Damn [FromFrom.GetHerHim]!
EVTTOOLTIP20390	A chance meeting with a local noble	The men I sent to deal with [FromFrom.GetTitledName] succeeded. [From.GetSheHeCap] will not bother me again...
EVTDESC20390	On the road to [From.Location.GetName] I met [From.GetTitledName], the Marshal of [From.Liege.GetTitledName]. I knew [From.GetSheHe] would be interested in the military advancements I have done lately. Should I share them with [From.GetHerHim]?	The local noble, [From.GetTitledName], tried to assure that I couldn't spread any rumors about him by sending some thugs to attack me!
EVTOPTA20390	I see no reason why not	Luckily I got away!

EVTOPTB20390	I better keep it to myself...	My liege, the local noble here in [From.Location.GetName], [FromFrom.GetTitledName], tried to silence me by sending some thugs to kill me!

I will go ahead and spread the rumor about [FromFrom.GetHerHis] corruption and destroy [FromFrom.GetHerHis] reputation among [FromFrom.GetHerHis] vassals.\n\nYour humble Spymaster,\n[From.GetTitledName]
EVTDESC20391	I left the soldiers of [Root.Location.GetName] one evening feeling exhausted and world-weary when a local noble, [From.GetTitledName], approached me and told me about the military advancements he had implemented lately. I promised [From.GetHerHim] to use it wisely and not spread the knowledge outside the realm.	You have my blessing!
EVTOPTA20391	Such an important discovery must be shared with my liege!	My spymaster, [From.GetTitledName] has been murdered! That noble he was investigating, [FromFrom.GetTitledName], seems reasonable to be behind this, but I have no proof...

EVTDESC20392	My liege, good news! During my mission to [From.Location.GetName] I happened to meet the noble [FromFrom.GetTitledName]. After promising [FromFrom.GetHerHim] not to divulge any of the information outside the realm, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] decided to share with me some of the military advancements [FromFrom.GetSheHe] had implemented in the last year. Enclosed with this letter is a document describing them in more detail.\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName]	The rumors about me being corrupt is of course false, but I realize that you already know this and that I do not have much of a choice.

EVTOPTA20410	Let us hope so	I was skeptical about my visit to [Root.Location.GetName] to try and find some way to get into the thickheaded peasants how different sorts of military equipment should be best used. Of course they managed to fumble...
EVTNAME942	Noble Interferes	They wounded me!
EVTDESC942	The levy situation in [Root.Location.GetName] is not entirely hopeless, but close enough. I will do my best to revive the situation and hopefully my liege will see some results soon.	They maimed me!

EVTDESC20420	[From.Liege.GetTitledName]'s Marshal, [From.GetTitledName], have been trying to raise more and more levies in [From.Location.GetName]. I can't stand [From.GetHerHim]! Perhaps I should pull some strings and see to it that no more peasants show up for his recruiting meetings?	Oh dear...
EVTOPTA20420	I will take every chance I get!	My liege, I implore you to send me to another province! The nitwits of [From.Location.GetName] have already cost me an arm, I don't want to lose any more limbs just because they don't know the back from the front of an arrow!\n\nYour humble Marshal,\n[From.GetTitledName]

My [Root.GetChancellorName] told me a cook of all people have thwarted my plans.\n\n'News my $HONORIFIC$! They tell us the cook caught a man sneaking around the kitchen trying to poison $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ lunch! Luckily though they caught him red-handed.'
EVTDESC7175	An unsigned letter arrives.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, a little bird has whispered in my ear that you wish $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ would just...go away, and that you might be in need of assistance. Or should I say, assassins...? Should you choose to acquire my services, leave a satchel with the money and the victim's name inside the old oak tree just south of town.'	Yes, luckily...
EVTOPTA7175	That bird must have read my mind!	I apparently visited the local tavern yesterday, which would explain this hangover. What is worse though, is they tell me I may have blabbered about a certain 'plot'...
EVTOPTB7175	Tempting... but too risky.	Honey and water, you have screwed me again!
EVTOPTC7175	This is clearly a trap!	I never should have included that drunken blabbermouth, FROM_CHARACTERNAME, in a plot this delicate!
EVTDESC7200	My tedious research is finally done. I have managed to fabricate a claim on a title that one of my fellow co-conspirators should be very interested in.	My reputation is ruined!
EVTOPTA7200	This should be worth quite a lot!	This will not please $CHARACTERTITLE$ $CHARACTERNAME$...
EVTTOOLTIP7205	Receives a letter	The other plotters haven't lifted a finger against $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$! Maybe it is time for me to strike...
EVTDESC7250	My spymaster tells me that information about my plot to [Root.GetPlot] might have leaked to someone outside the conspiracy. We do not know who yet, but maybe we will hear from him...	I can't miss an opportunity like this.
EVTOPTA7250	Can my spymaster never bring me good news?	A better opportunity will present itself.
EVTDESC7255	I have learned that [From.GetTitledName] has started a plot to [From.GetPlot]. What should I do with this information?	$AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ is as good as dead...
EVTOPTA7255	A little blackmail can't hurt, can it?	Kill! Kill!
EVTOPTB7255	It does not concern me. Let it be.	Good news, my $HONORIFIC$! Our plan to let $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ meet $OPPOSITE_HIS_HER$ maker has finally come to fruition.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFROM_CHARACTERNAME
EVTTOOLTIP7260	Receives a letter	Oh my, what wonderful news!
EVTDESC7260	It has come to my attention that you are the leader of a plot to [Root.GetPlot]. I find this most fascinating, and I bet that others would too... I suspect that you wish to keep this a secret, but my silence comes with a price.\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	Assassinate $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$.
EVTOPTA7260	Bastard! But I don't have a choice...	My $HONORIFIC$, I write to you with both good and bad news. The bad news is that my attempt to murder $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ failed... The good news is that $OPPOSITE_HE_SHE$ was seriously wounded! So give it a little time and I am sure that the good lord will come and collect $OPPOSITE_HIM_HER$!\n\nSincerely,\n\nFROM_CHARACTERNAME
EVTOPTB7260	I won't tolerate blackmail!	At least we are making progress.
EVTDESC7265	I have no choice but to accept your despicable blackmail attempt. You have been given payment in full, and I expect your silence in this matter from now on.	$AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ is wounded.
EVTDESC7270	I will never succumb to blackmail! I rather face the embarrassment of having my plot exposed than giving you a single coin.	Unfortunately I am writing to you with bad news. Our plan to assassinate $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ has met with failure. The man I trusted to carry out the attempt failed miserably.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFROM_CHARACTERNAME
EVTOPTA7270	Damn	Do I have to do everything myself?
EVTOPTA8000	I guess I have no choice...	The assassination attempt fails.
EVTDESC8050	Rather than risking civil war tearing the realm apart, I have decided to give in to your demand and hand my title over to you. But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	My $HONORIFIC$, despite what you may have heard, I assure you that the moment just wasn't right for carrying out our plan against $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$. Any half-hearted or ill-conceived attempts at this moment would only risk exposing our intentions without accomplishing our goals. Therefor I deceided it was best to wait for a better opportunity.\n\nSincerely,\n\nFROM_CHARACTERNAME

But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	I will send a letter informing $CHARACTERTITLE$ $CHARACTERNAME$ why I didn't act.
EVTDESC8100	Your shameful attempt at blackmail has not succeeded. No matter how many corrupted souls you have enticed to help carry out your plan I will not give in without a fight. I'd rather die defending what is rightfully mine!\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	An unsigned letter arrives.\n\n'My $HONORIFIC$, a little bird has whispered in my ear that you wish $AMBITION_TARGET_NAME$ would just...go away, and that you might be in need of assistance. Or should I say, assassins...? Should you choose to acquire my services, leave a satchel with the money and the victim's name inside the old oak tree just south of town.'
EVTOPTA8100	Then war it is!	That bird must have read my mind!
EVTOPTB8100	Actually going to war was not my plan...	Tempting... but too risky.
EVTDESC8066	Rather than risking civil war tearing the realm apart, I have decided to give in to your demand and change the laws of inheritance to gavelkind. But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	This is clearly a trap!

But this treacherous act of blackmail will not be forgotten...\n\nSigned,\n[From.GetTitledName]	My tedious research is finally done. I have managed to fabricate a claim on a title that one of my fellow co-conspirators should be very interested in.

LINE_OF_SUCCESSION	§YLine of Succession§W	September 20, 1066 AD. King Harold Godwinson rushes to defend the shores of England against the forces of his traitorous brother Tostig and the Norwegian king Harald IV, nicknamed 'Hårdråde' (Hard Ruler). Meanwhile, William, Duke of Normandy, is about to launch his own invasion of England, sanctioned by Pope Alexander II himself. Saxon, Norse, or Norman - who shall rule Albion?

Victorious at the hard-fought Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy, has proclaimed himself King of England. Displaced Saxon lords rage against the French speaking usurpers as fief after fief is given to William's loyal followers. In Anatolia, the Seljuk Turks under the great sultan Alp Arslan are about to invade the Byzantine Empire in a struggle that will determine the fate of Asia Minor...

TITLE_CANNOT_BE_FREE_TAG	The title must have de jure vassals.	Jerusalem has fallen to the forces of the great infidel, Saladin, but Henry II of England, Philip II of France, and Holy Roman Emperor Frederick 'Barbarossa' have, in their righteous zeal, ended their petty disputes and stand ready to march against the Moor in the most powerful Crusade yet...

tut_0a_7	To the upper right you can open the family and dynasty trees. Above that you'll see a small 'W' icon. Sometimes you can click this and it will link you to the actual character on Wikipedia. You can also see the titles and claims here, as well as the stats and traits the character has.

The next row contains information about what kind of troops you have in this unit. Then you have three parts on the lower part of this screen. The army is usually divided into three flanks, but this is such a small army, so that is not neccesary. Open the military tab again to learn about handling your army.	Actions and Modifiers
tut_5a_8	More Armies	Let's take a look at personal diplomacy first. You have a tab in the middle that says 'Vassals', click that.
#tut_5a_9	This time, also raise all your vassal levies. Now you have a lot of troops, and they are split up all over your realm. Drag a box around them to select all of them, then right click on the province Ross to make them all go there. Now unpause to continue.	Now, if you hover over the opinion values, the green or red numbers towards the right, you'll see why each person has a particular opinion of you.
tut_5a_10	Maneuver	For example, check what the tooltip says for Muireadhach of Strathearn. His opinion of us is 26, based on personal diplomacy, free investiture (that we can appoint bishops), autonomous vassals, that he is the steward, and then we have a red number for patient vs. wroth. That means he is patient, we are wroth, and these two personalities just does not match. Click next to continue.
#tut_5a_11	Once you have all of them gathered, select them by dragging a box around them and use the arrows that meet to merge all of them. Now to move them onto a fleet. Click the military tab.

Then we have temporary modifiers of course. 
#tut_5a_13	Now, when your troops reach Gowrie, select them. To move them onto your ships, there is an embark button. Right now it is grey though. To find out why, click your ships. At the bottom, you can see that the load capacity is not really enough. We need to split your grand army again. Select your army and click the arrows moving apart to divide your army. Move the two first entries to the new army. That gives us 285 troops, which is a good match to load the ships with. Click next to continue.	Temporary modifiers have an expiration date. If your rules dies and the new heir takes over, most vassals will dislike them for ten years for example. Click next to continue. 
#tut_5a_14	Onto the Ships	Claims and Titles
#tut_5a_15	Now click select on the right army to choose the new one. The embark button is now blue and useable, so click it. Ships move exactly like armies, so move this fleet to the neighboring sea province, Moray Firth, to continue. 	To be able to declare war, there are a few different methods including plots and holy war, but the most common way is to simply claim the title you are interested in.
tut_5a_30	War	You do this by clicking the province you want, and then click the diplomacy button. There will be a button named 'claim title', press that and you will see what titles this character inherits. Click one of the titles and you will also see what claiming it will cost you. The price is paid in prestige and by lowering the holder's opinion of course. 
tut_5a_31	Now what is this? A neighboring count has declared war on us! We must defend ourselves and let us do that by attacking. Take your army and move it to Argyll to the west. Unpause to continue.	Now you have the claim, but if you want the land, you will need to take action. The claim is held by your current ruler, so as soon as you change ruler, the claim will be gone. Click next to end this part.
tut_5a_32	Fight	
tut_5a_33	When we run into the enemies troops, we will start to fight them. The stages of the battle will be covered in the advanced tutorial. For now, lets just wait until the battle end screen shows up.	
tut_5a_34	Victory!	
tut_5a_35	You won! Here you can see how many troops both of you had before the fight, how many casualties there were on both sides and then how many troops are remaining. Click ok. Now we stand in an enemy province with no troops in it. That means our troops will automatically start to siege. Click the province to continue.	Diplomacy - Advanced Level
tut_5a_36	Siege	There are no formal alliances in Crusader Kings II, it is all a matter of bloodlines, dynasty and prestige.
tut_5a_37	The province screen will look different now that we are sieging. You'll see how many people you have attacking the holding, and you can see the number of defenders remaining. The attackers must outnumber the defenders, or the siege will not progress. Now, lets speed up the time a bit so the sieging goes faster. Increase the speed to maximum to continue.	Our wife is dead, so now would be a good time to marry into another dynasty to form bonds that can be used. Click your ruler portrait to continue.

tut_5a_39	Eventually the siege will end, and since the enemy had no more troops and you outnumber him, we know you will win. Once the end screen is displayed, you'll see how much prestige and gold the siege won you, your casualties and the enemies casualties. Press next to end this part.	Below the portrait of your wife are two golden rings on blue background. This is a button that will allow you to arrange a marriage for the current character.

Some are too young, a real marriage will not start until both of you are over 16. Some are too old, you want them to be able to have your children. Some have nothing to offer you. To help you decide, there are buttons that can sort the list according to your desires. Click next to continue.
##### Military - Medium		Find a Suitable Mate
######################################################################		If you know what dynasty you want to marry into, sort by dynasty. If you are primarily looking to up your military score, sort by martial skill. Right now we are looking for a way to expand our influence though, so sort them by rank.
tut_5b_1	Military - Intermediate Level	The first one, Mathilde, is a duchess of Toscana, duchess of Spoleto and heir to the county of Firenze. Not too shabby, let's go with her. Click her portrait and you will see that you will gain some prestige, but also lose some since you are a king marrying a duchess. You can also see that she will answer yes to your proposal, so just go ahead and send it.
tut_5b_2	Levies are what we call the usual kind of troops in Crusader Kings II. Other kinds will be discussed in the advanced Military tutorial. Exactly how many and what kind of levies your vassals send you depends on the holding composition and how much the vassals like you. Open the military tab to continue.	Now you are a full-fledged diplomat, time to move on! Click next to end this part.
tut_5b_3	Levies	
#tut_5b_4	In the military tab you can see that there are a few different kind of levies. Your personal levy, vassal levies and realm levies. Yours are the ones you control yourself. The vassal levies are controlled by your direct vassals, and the realm levies are controlled by everyone in your realm that have access to levies, i.e. the vassals of your vassals are included.

tut_5b_5	Levy Composition	
tut_5b_6	Castle gives you the most troops, period. They also reinforce faster. These holding give you some light cavalry, light infantry and most heavy infantry.	Military - Basic Level

tut_5b_8	Temples give you some galleys, and then archers, light infantry and heavy infantry.	Raising Troops
tut_5b_9	Exactly what levies you will get from a province also depends on other things, like who the vassal is. Since castles are so occupied with providing troops, they yield less taxes for you than the other two, while cities give you much more. Click next to end this part.	This is the military screen. Here you can see how many troops you have, how many you can raise and what they will cost you. 
######################################################################		For this exercise, we need troops, so click the button with an up arrow here to raise your personal retinue. Now you'll see your new troop in the province Gowrie. Select the troop by clicking on the shield.

######################################################################		Now you get some information about this army. The name is 'Army of King Malcolm III', and it has a number of people in it. At the top you have the organization bar, that tells you in how good condition the troops are. Then you have the regent shield and buttons to manage the army. The next row contains information about what kind of troops you have in this unit. Then you have three parts on the lower part of this screen. The army is usually divided into three flanks, but this is such a small army, so that is not neccesary. Open the military tab again to learn about handling your army.
tut_5c_1	Military - Advanced Level	More Armies
tut_5c_2	We have some concepts that are new to this installment of Crusader Kings. Open the military tab to learn more about mercenaries, holy orders and flanks.	This time, also raise all your vassal levies. Now you have a lot of troops, and they are split up all over your realm. Drag a box around them to select all of them, then right click on the province Ross to make them all go there. Now unpause to continue.
tut_5c_3	Mercenaries	Maneuver
tut_5c_4	Mercenaries are hired troops under your direct control. Click the Mercenaries tab to see what kind of mercenaries are available to you. Here you can see that when you hire them, they cost a rather hefty sum of money. Then below each hire button, you can see the monthly cost, which is smaller but still substantial. If you find yourself unable to pay them when the time has come, they might attack you and take provinces. Their loyalty lies with the gold only. Click the holy orders tab to continue. 	Once you have all of them gathered, select them by dragging a box around them and use the arrows that meet to merge all of them. Now to move them onto a fleet. Click the military tab.

We need to split your grand army again. Select your army and click the arrows moving apart to divide your army. Move the two first entries to the new army. That gives us 285 troops, which is a good match to load the ships with. Click next to continue.
#tut_5c_7	These troops will fight for free, but they only attack religious enemies, and they only exist around the time of crusades, so they are a bit limited. Now, raise your personal levy and select it to continue.	Onto the Ships
tut_5c_8	Flanks	Now click select on the right army to choose the new one. The embark button is now blue and useable, so click it. Ships move exactly like armies, so move this fleet to the neighboring sea province, Moray Firth, to continue.

tut_5c_10	Tactics	Now what is this? A neighboring count has declared war on us! We must defend ourselves and let us do that by attacking. Take your army and move it to Argyll to the west. Unpause to continue.
tut_5c_11	Each flank has a commander that will choose the tactic to use. When deciding this he is considering what kind of troops he has and what kind of troops the enemy have and adapts. How good he is at this depends on his military skill. Click next to end this part.	Fight

The playable ranks are: Count/Countess -> Duke/Duchess -> King/Queen -> Emperor/Empress. Click the laws tab to continue.	Religion - Basic Level
tut_9b_5	Laws	Religion with all that implies, can have a big impact on what happens in your game. Crusades, piety and your own religios vassals will all play their part. The church head, which will be either a pope, caliph or an ecumenical patriarch, is the religious power for each of their religions. The pope can not just start holy wars, he is also the one that can grant you a divorce for example. Click the religion tab to continue.
#tut_9b_6	Here in the bottom part of the laws window you can see the laws that affect your vassals. You have (besides the crown laws), laws regulating taxation and levies for the three kinds of vassals. The minimum varieties will give you less money and direct control over fewer troops. The right part with harsh taxes and maximum levies give you more money and troops, but makes your vassals rather displeased. Click next to end this part.	Window Overview
######################################################################		Here you will see that you are part of the catholic church, and you can also find the pope here and see whether he likes you or not. A high moral authority is good for the church, and bad for those who oppose it.
##### Feudal - Advanced		If the pope has called to a crusade, that will be listed here. The bottom part of this window lists your vassal bishops and lets you appoint successors for each one of them. Click next to end this part.

tut_9c_2	The changes from the previous game are two new hierarchy levels and crown laws. Click next to continue	
tut_9c_3	The Hierarchy	Religion - Intermediate Level
tut_9c_4	The two new hierarchy levels are emperor/empress and baron/baroness. The emperor sits in the absolute top above kings, and this is a playable character. The barons on the other hand are towards the lower end of the scale. They are beneath counts, and they are not playable. Lets move on to the crown laws. Click the laws tab to continue.	This part of the tutorial will teach you about opinions, laws and crusades. Click next to continue.
tut_9c_5	Crown Laws	Religious Vassals
#tut_9c_6	In the bottom part of this window, you see the laws that are not related to succession. On the top you have the laws marked with a crown, which means they are crown laws. They concern how much freedom a king or emperor has. The first one is crown authority and give a wide range of effects depending on what setting it is at. Your vassals will be hard to convince, but if they like you enough and you have high prestige, they will pose but a minor problem.	Religious vassals will only give you troops and money if they have a higher opinion of you than they do of the pope. The easiest way to assure that, is to actually appoint someone to bishop that already likes you. Click the laws tab to see how you can accomplish that.
tut_9c_7	The other crown law is investiture. It can be either you or the pope that appoints bishops. Either choice will have some side-effects as well, so be sure to check the tooltip before you change. Click next to end this last part of the tutorial.	Investiture
######################################################################		The top part of the laws window are the succession laws, but lets skip those for now. Among the laws in the lower part, you'll find investiture. This can either be set to papal, which means the pope elects the bishops, or free, which means that you can select your bishops by yourself. The pope will not be happy of course. Click next to learn about crusades.
##### General		Crusades
######################################################################		What instigates a crusade is that the pope appoints an area that needs to be conquered in the name of the catholic church. For him to be able to do that, it must currently be held by Muslims or Pagans. When he does this, you will get access to a casus belli you can use to attack the top liege of the province in question.
tutorial_chapter_economy_basic	End of the basic economy tutorial	If you choose to not attack, some of your vassals might be disappointed, but the pope will not punish you.
tutorial_chapter_economy_intm	End of the intermediary economy tutorial	Should you choose to join the crusade and manage to be the one that wins the province, you will get the very nice bonus that this usually gives. That would come in the form of piety and prestige. You will then get to keep that and all provinces you have taken, as well as a crusader trait.
tutorial_chapter_council_basic	End of the basic council tutorial	Should you join the crusade but one of the other Catholics win the holy province, you will not get the crusade bonus, but you can take other provinces, and you will also get the crusader trait. Click next to end this part.

This antipope can then be used to go to war with the current pope, and if you win, you can replace the pope with your antipope. Click the religion tab to continue.
tutorial_chapter_war_basic	End of the basic war tutorial	Antipope
tutorial_chapter_war_intm	End of the intermediary war tutorial	What you need to create an antipope is: free investiture and a bishop that likes you more than the pope. As you can see here, you have a bishop. Unfortunately, he does not like you very much. Had he done that though, we could have clicked the little button to the right and made him an antipope. 
tutorial_chapter_military_basic	End of the basic military tutorial.	Once you have your very own antipope, people who like your antipope more than the pope will pay taxes to you instead, you can circumvent excommunications and you can go to war against the pope in your antipopes place.
