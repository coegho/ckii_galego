RIP.30300.title	Rumors of an Immortal
RIP.30300.title.b	A scrawled letter arrives
RIP.30300.d.highlander	Word has reached you that there is another Immortal, Ramirez, who is seeking you out. This Spaniard has heard of your Immortality and has vowed to put it to an end. While his motivations are unknown, his intentions appear clear and it is only a matter of time until he finds you.
RIP.30300.d.evildude	Word of a monstrous man has reached you. This sadistic creature, known as Uran, is also Immortal and has dedicated his long life to inflicting cruelty upon others in the most terrible ways he can imagine. Rumors say his cruelty is only outmatched by his all-consuming jealousy, and hearing of another Immortal has driven him into a frothing rage. If these rumors are to be believed, he is certain track you down and attempt to kill you sooner rather than later...
RIP.30300.d.goodguy	Of late you have been hearing tales of another Immortal, Arthur. This man, this paragon of goodness, seems to have devoted his life to helping others and righting wrongs. It seems like a dull life, but everyone needs a hobby you suppose. You have never considered yourself a bad sort, perhaps a little boisterous at times, but Arthur seems to have some kind of grudge against you. Phrases such as 'ending the reign of terror' and 'stopping the unending bloodshed' have been bandied about. It all seems very excessive.
RIP.30300.d.shieldmaiden	Bards sing of a Shieldmaiden named Torhild, or perhaps she is a Valkyrie walking the earth. Regardless, it is said she is another Immortal and that she thrives on battle. In the most popular ballad she fights her greatest duel against an immortal man named Caine, and after her victory she weeps because she will never again find such a worthy foe. If these tales are true, she may well seek you out and challenge you to a duel.
RIP.30300.d.horse	While the penmanship is atrocious you notice that, curiously, the word-choice indicates a fairly intelligent writer:\n'I do not appreciate imitators, especially in such a blatant display which could draw attention to all of our kind. I am coming for you. You cannot outrun me. I shall burn your city to the ground, it won't be the first I have destroyed. I shall lay waste to your people and trample your legacy into the dirt, as I have done before to greater men. History will view you as a lunatic who destroyed themselves through pride and folly. Await me in terror.'\nThe letter is not signed.
RIP.30300.a	Bring them on!
RIP.30300.b	I don't like the sound of this!
RIP.30300.c	It's not as if I flay people. Often.

RIP.30301.d.highlander	As you step out your rooms you barely have time to wonder where your guards are before you are confronted by [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]\n'Your life ends now!' he shouts, raising his sword.
RIP.30301.d.evildude	As you step out your rooms you barely have time to wonder where your guards are before you are confronted by [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]\n 'Time to die, you [GetFromRootInsult]!' he growls, hefting his sword.
RIP.30301.d.goodguy	As you step out your rooms notice the odd absence of your guards for a moment before [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] steps out in front of you.\n'It is time to bring an end to you,' he says, somewhat sadly, 'make your peace with your god.'
RIP.30301.d.shieldmaiden	The hallway is deserted of everyone except an armored women you suspect is [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]. Your suspicions are confirmed when she introduces herself and challenges you to a duel.
RIP.30301.d.horse	The corridor is splatted with blood and the bodies of your guards lie broken and trampled everywhere you look. A massive horse stands in the midst of the slaughter, steam rising from his flanks. You notice the mangled body of [immortal_horse_victim.GetBestName] by his hooves.\n'I am Incitatus, trampler of nations!' he announces 'I brook no imitations. You're next.'
RIP.30301.d.horse2	The corridor is splatted with blood and the bodies of your guards lie broken and trampled everywhere you look. A massive horse stands in the midst of the slaughter, steam rising from his flanks. You notice the mangled body of [immortal_horse_victim.GetBestName] by his hooves.\n'I am Incitatus, trampler of nations!' he announces 'I herd you had put a horse on your council, but it seems I was misinformed. Nonetheless, you're next.'
RIP.30302.d	Without hesitation you tear your sword from its sheath and leap to the attack. [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] seems startled by the ferocity of your onslaught is barely able to parry your first few blows. You feign a small overextension of your thrust and [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] takes the bait: As [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] attempt a counter-attack your blade snaps down and takes [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] hand clean off at the wrist. Before [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] can do more than gasp at the sudden pain your sword whips up and around, slicing [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] head from [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] shoulders.
RIP.30302.a	All too easy, [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]!
RIP.30303.d	Overcoming your brief surprize, you snatch a dagger from your belt and launch yourself at [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]! [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] appears to be startled by the speed of your assault, but manages a hasty block and counter-attack. However, they are completely unprepared for you catching [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] blade in your free hand and plunging your dagger into [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] wide-open eye.
RIP.30303.a	Another victory, another scar.
RIP.30304.d	As [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] rushes towards you with [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] sword held high. You barely have time to draw your own dagger and launch a desperate thrust as [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] it swings down at you. Your knife pierces [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] heart at the same time as [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] blade cuts into your flesh.
RIP.30304.a	Urgh... Still alive. Still alive!
RIP.30305.d	You fumble for your sword as [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] charges at you, blade hissing towards your face. Somehow you manage to parry [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] first blow, and then [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] second, but you know you are out-matched. Desperately you launch a flurry of blows, but all of a sudden there is a flash of steel coming at you and your vision begins to spin.
RIP.30305.a	???
RIP.30306.d	With a sudden jolt your vision clears. For a moment, before darkness closes over you, you are puzzled to see [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] standing over a headless body. You briefly wonder where it came from.

You brush some entrails from your shoulder and continue about your business.
placeholdername_4	I wonder who that was?
placeholdername_5	GRRRRRAAARGH!
placeholdername_6	Huh, picked up a scratch.
placeholdername_7	As [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] rushes towards you, you let out a high-pitched scream and throw yourself to the floor. This seems to take [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] by surprize as [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] trips over your sprawled form. You leap to your feet and are about to flee the scene when you realize [immortal_rival.GetFirstName] is not getting up again, [immortal_rival.GetSheHe] somehow landed on [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] own sword.
placeholdername_8	That was lucky!
placeholdername_9	Oh [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName], I'm dying!
placeholdername_10	Not today, [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]!
placeholdername_11	Thinking quickly you step backwards into your chambers and press the concealed button in the door frame. The hidden trapdoor outside opens under [immortal_rival.GetFirstName]'s feet as [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] charge carries [immortal_rival.GetHerHim] towards you, turning [immortal_rival.GetHerHis] scream of anger into a squeal of surprize.

You discreetly pull the silent-alarm rope and several squads of soldiers rush from their secret posts to swarm [immortal_rival.GetFirstName].

placeholdername_27	Spring a logical trap

placeholdername_30	I think, therefore I am.

EVTOPTB_RIP_12074_TT	§Y[partying_stranger.GetFirstName]§! leaves the room.\n
EVTOPTC_RIP_12074	I might have to deal with that...
EVTDESC_RIP_12075_A	During yet another evening of wine-fueled relaxation I approach [bored_courtier_target.GetTitledName] just as a tall clock strikes the hour. The sound causes the lute player to halt and my courtiers to glance cautiously at each other. "Is that masked one a friend of yours?" I inquire. [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] shakes [bored_courtier_target.GetHerHis] head.
EVTDESC_RIP_12075_B	I'm in the middle of a staring contest with the masked stranger when I sneeze violently. The sound causes the lute player to halt and my courtiers to glance cautiously at each other. "D'you know where I can get a mask like that?" [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] shakes [bored_courtier_target.GetHerHis] head.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12075	I should just talk to [partying_stranger.GetHerHim], before this turns awkward.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12075_TT	You take a deep breath and decide that you will soon make time to approach the masked stranger in a casual manner.\n
EVTOPTB_RIP_12075	How dare a stranger sneak into our midst like this?!
EVTOPTB_RIP_12075_TT	You are outraged and decide that you'll have to approach the masked stranger with fierce determination.\n
EVTOPTC_RIP_12075	Wait...is that who I think it is?
EVTOPTC_RIP_12075_TT	There is something ethereal about the masked stranger and you think you know why.\n
EVTOPTD_RIP_12075	Actually, I think I recognize that figure...
EVTOPTD_RIP_12075_TT	There is something unnatural about the stranger and you feel a mild panic rising in your chest.\n
EVTOPTE_RIP_12075	[bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName], you're just NO help at all!
EVTOPTE_RIP_12075_TT	You will simply ask the darkly clad figure yourself.\n
EVTDESC_RIP_12076	[partying_stranger.GetTitledName] has apparently disappeared from court. I've had my men look for the masked stranger, but all that has been found is their mask. It apparently smelled wretchedly, so I can't blame the servant for burning it.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12076	I wonder who [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] was?
EVTOPTA_RIP_12076_TT	You can't put your finger on why, but you are relieved.\n
EVTDESC_RIP_12077	I make my way deeper into the hall where the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] usually stands alone, a figure veiled in candlelight shadows. "Have we met?" I employ my most disarming smile - I wasn't made [Root.GetTitle] for naught! The stranger remains silent. That's when I notice the smell and I grow cold.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12077	Wait, are those... buboes on your skin?
RIP_12077_TT_good_outcome	Something strange happens.\n
RIP_12077_TT_bad_outcome	Something terrible happens.\n
EVTDESC_RIP_12078	"YOU!", I call one final evening, pointing at the masked figure. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] is standing in the middle of a room, seemingly with an invisible aura repelling any company. As I get closer I understand why - the smell makes me convulse, but the [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] says nothing.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12078	Who... WHAT are you?
EVTOPTA_RIP_12078_TT	Something strange happens.\n
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_A	The stranger seems curious and then taken aback as I approach. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me, questioningly. "Death, I presume?". The darkly clad figure shrugs, expression unreadable under the mask. Then [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] lunges at me while my courtiers gasp in horror.
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_B	The stranger tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me as I approach. I attempt a reassuring smile. "You look like you could use a walk", I say, offering up my arm. Hesitantly, the darkly clad figure takes it. My heart pounding, I lead [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] away from my courtiers. [partying_stranger.GetHerHisCap] grip is cold as ice.
EVTDESC_RIP_12079_C	The stranger tilts [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head at me as I approach. "That is a beautiful mask!" I call to [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]. As if by challenge, the stranger reaches up to [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] face and removes the mask, revealing a ghastly black hole where [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] face should be.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12079	Oh, this is not good.
EVTOPTB_RIP_12079	You, uhm, come here often?
EVTOPTB_RIP_12079_TT	The masked stranger remains quiet.\n
EVTOPTC_RIP_12079	Oh, you look just like in my vision!
EVTOPTC_RIP_12079_TT	The masked stranger remains still, but doesn't seem entirely satisfied with your reaction.\n
RIP_12080_TITLE	Behind the Mask of Death
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_A	"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] reaches for you. The words ring out as you struggle to protest the motion of [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] hand and your companions gasp in horror when the blackened fingers of the creature seem to stretch into your chest itself. You throw your head back and scream as a sharp pain runs like lightning through your entire body. As you collapse to your knees you hear others screaming as well, an unholy mixture of outrage, sorrow and panic. With your last breaths you turn to see the people of your court falling to the floor as well, red light flooding the room.\n\nAnd then all was quiet.
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_B	"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] reaches for you. The words ring out as you struggle to protest the motion of [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] hand and your companions gasp in horror when the blackened fingers of the creature seem to stretch into your chest itself.

As you collapse to your knees you hear others screaming as well, an unholy mixture of outrage, sorrow and panic. With your last breaths you turn to see the people of your court falling to the floor as well, red light flooding the room.\n\nAnd then all was quiet.
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_C	The mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] dashes against your chest, with what you expect to be a hard push. You scream, mostly in surprise, as you realize that [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] has simply moved through you, leaving a cold sensation in your flesh. Behind you, chaos ensues as the figure moves with unnatural speed, running as a ghost through your court and its people. Black smoke trails faintly behind [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] and the screams are mingled with the sudden and loud striking of a clock, its echoes ringing in your ears as the shadowy creature turns to look at you one last time. "Seize [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]!" you yell, but no guards heed your call. As you are watching [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] the stranger becomes translucent. Before you know it, you're staring at the thin air.
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_D	Walking side by side with [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] you are stewing over your suspicions. Would Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself] really be so brass as to show up at your court? Has the Reaper nothing better to do? Surely this is just some plague-ridden spy! Yet [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] odor really is unnaturally repugnant...\nYour ruminations are interrupted by a low hiss - it hasn't taken the mysterious [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] long to figure out your plan. The ballroom trapdoor is quite visible, even if you are not Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself] and possessing, one could presume, some measure of superior senses. By your side, you feel the nails of the creature digging into your skin, which then begins to turn black, filling with buboes. You scream.
EVTDESC_RIP_12080_E	"Oh yeah, we've met before. We had tea?", you continue. Death shakes [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head, black smoke twirling around [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]. Your courtiers, who have been shocked into silence, are beginning to frantically move about, looking to all at once exit the room. Stumbling over one another, Death creeps towards them, as if not really in a hurry. You notice that each person [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] brushes past gently collapses to the floor, before even having time to scream or call for help. "How dare you?!" you yell, outraged at the impudence. "Those are my guests!" [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] then turns to you, approaching quickly in a cloud of darkness.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12080	Aaarrgh...
EVTOPTA_RIP_12080_TT	Death gets what [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] came for and leaves your court.\n
EVTOPTB_RIP_12080	Aaarrgh...
EVTOPTB_RIP_12080_TT	Death gets what [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] came for and leaves your court.\n
EVTOPTC_RIP_12080	Nooo!
EVTOPTC_RIP_12080_TT	Death gets what [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] came for and leaves your court.\n
EVTOPTD_RIP_12080	No, please! I'm too young!!!
EVTOPTD_RIP_12080_TT	Your plan to trick Death fails. You die. Death leaves your court.\n
EVTOPTE_RIP_12080	Wait, no!!
EVTOPTE_RIP_12080_TT	You die. Death leaves your court.\n
RIP_12081_TITLE	Don't Fear the Reaper
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_A	"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious stranger reaches for you. You quickly duck out of [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] way, a motion accompanied by an appreciative gasp from your courtiers. The creature seems taken aback, but slowly spins towards you again. "Take this!" a guard bellows as a tall candelabra is thrown to you, candlelights ablaze. Hesitating for only a second, you decide to wield it as you would any fighting cane - you begin swinging the fiery weapon passionately in the direction of what you decide must be Death [partying_stranger.GetHerselfHimself]. "LEAVE this place!" you roar, ushering [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] away from the crowd. Then, in a sudden poof of black smoke, you find your opponent gone. The room grows quiet.
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_B	"Watch out, my [Root.GetLordLady]!", [bored_courtier_target.GetFirstName] yells as the mysterious stranger reaches for you.

"LEAVE this place!" you roar, ushering [partying_stranger.GetHerHim] away from the crowd. Then, in a sudden poof of black smoke, you find your opponent gone. The room grows quiet.
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_C	The sensation of being run through by Death itself is not something that you could quite explain. As it happens you inhale sharply, expecting pain to shoot through your body, expecting your vision to blur, or at least your knees to give way. When nothing happens, the ghostly apparition of a [partying_stranger.GetManWoman] turns around, throwing [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] hands out in the air, seemingly confused.\n"I guess it doesn't work on me?" you offer, something apologetic in your voice.
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_D	Sweat begins to trickle down the side of your brow as you get closer to your goal. You realize that the ballroom trapdoor is clearly visible, if one knows what to look for. "So the weather we've been having lately, eh?", you blabber nervously. The masked figure by your side stiffens a little before exhaling deeply, causing a cold draft through the room and your hairs to stand on end. [partying_stranger.GetSheHeCap] answers in a hollow voice: "It's such a chore, this job, honestly. It's easier when you folks make war, reaping each oth-".\nThe words are cut short as you hit the switch on the wall, sending the creature falling to your basement. A small puff of black smoke lingers by your side and your courtiers begin to clap as you drag the carpet back over the trapdoor.
EVTDESC_RIP_12081_E	"Oh yeah, we've met before. We had tea?", you continue. Death shakes [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head, black smoke twirling around [partying_stranger.GetHerHim]. Your courtiers, who have been shocked into silence, are beginning to frantically move about, looking to all at once exit the room. Stumbling over one another, Death creeps towards them, as if not really in a hurry. "Wait!" you yell. "Can't we make a deal? I hear you like that?" Your invisible friend Jarvis nods solemnly as you offer him up to Death in exchange for the lives of your courtiers. Death appears to throw [partying_stranger.GetHerHis] head back, as if in a hearty chuckle. People stare at you in awe as the darkness suddenly leaves the room. You'll miss Jarvis, but this is exactly what happened in your dream. He knew the stakes.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12081	That was close.
EVTOPTA_RIP_12081_TT	Death leaves your court.\n
EVTOPTB_RIP_12081	That was close.

EVTOPTC_RIP_12081_TT	Outraged, Death leaves your court. 
EVTOPTD_RIP_12081	I really don't get to use these enough.
EVTOPTD_RIP_12081_TT	Unsure whether you are on their to-do-list or not, it would seem that Death leaves your court for now.\n
EVTOPTE_RIP_12081	I guess we'll meet again...
EVTOPTE_RIP_12081_TT	Having struck a deal with Death, it would seem that [partying_stranger.GetSheHe] leaves your court for now.\n
