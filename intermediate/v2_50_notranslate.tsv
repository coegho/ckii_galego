BM_CHARLEMAGNE_ERA	Early Middle Ages
BM_CHARLEMAGNE_ERA_INFO	The Early Middle Ages started with the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the early 5th century. The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent...
BM_THE_OLD_GODS_ERA	Viking Age
BM_THE_OLD_GODS_ERA_INFO	By the middle of the 9th century, the Norse raiders and adventurers known as the Vikings had already begun to set their indelible mark on the map of Europe, establishing realms in Russia and the British Isles and travelling and raiding as far as the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. The Karling rulers, descendants of Charlemagne, ruled mighty realms in France, Germany and Italy, while the Muslim religion was now firmly established in Spain under the Umayyads. The Byzantine emperor held on, though suffering under increasing pressure from the Caliphate and the Bulgarians. West of the fractured Steppes, The Magyars were poised to make their claim on the Carpathian basin. Islam was spreading rapidly in Persia under rulers such as the Saffarids, and had penetrated into the Indus valley. Further East, the Hindu Pratihara dynasty was expanding.
BM_FATE_OF_ENGLAND_ERA	High Middle Ages
BM_FATE_OF_ENGLAND_ERA_INFO	By the late 10th and early 11th centuries the Muslim world was changing, with Turkish dynasties such as the Seljuks and Ghaznavids now dominating Persia. The Byzantine Empire was still holding its own but was to see worse times coming. Central and Western continental Europe was split between France and a strong Holy Roman Empire, while Christian kings were advancing against a fractured and weakened Muslim Spain. Scandinavia was quickly converting to Christianity, and the Norse settlers in Russia and Britain had become assimilated with the local populations. Yet Viking descendants in Normandy and Italy were preparing new conquests, and the time of the First Crusade was approaching...
BM_THE_MONGOLS_ERA	Age of the Mongols
BM_THE_MONGOLS_ERA_INFO	As Europe entered the 13th century, Constantinople had been weakened by the Turks and sacked by the Fourth Crusade, so the Byzantine Empire was very much weakened. The Turks still reigned in the Middle East and Persia, in India many new kingdoms vied for power after the fall of the old dynasties. The Norman conquest had brought new political and dynastic struggles to England and France, the Christian kingdoms in Spain were continually growing stronger, Scandinavia had left paganism behind and was becoming more centralized. In Russia several principalities struggled for power in the shadow of the Bolghars and Cumans to the east. In Germany and Italy, the Holy Roman Empire still stood firm, but beyond all this, to the east, a new power was to come into play. When the Mongols broke into Eastern Europe and Persia, it changed the balance of power in all of Western Eurasia...
BM_100_YEARS_WAR_ERA	Late Middle Ages
BM_100_YEARS_WAR_ERA_INFO	Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring...
