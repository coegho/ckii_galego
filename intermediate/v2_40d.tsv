#feudal_government_desc	Feudal government revolves around the oath between liege and vassal, and Feudal lords can only directly own so many Holdings before they must start to rely on vassals - whose loyalty may vary... There are several Succession Laws to pick between - each with its own merits. The Centralization Law controls the maximum size of your Demesne and the number of direct vassals you can have.
#muslim_government_desc	The Arabic Iqta system is similar to the Feudal system - rulers must rely on land holding vassals or varying loyalty and ambition. The maximum number of vassals and the number of Holdings you can directly own are controlled by the Centralization Law. However, there is only one form of Succession available - the chaotic 'Open' type, where the son with most land inherits.
nomadic_government_desc	Nomads are not very interested in owning Holdings, only in more grazing land for their sheep and horses. Gameplay centers around the Population of the tribe and the Manpower it provides. Empty Holdings slots in open terrain increases the maximum population. While Nomads can have normal vassals, they are mostly concerned with managing the other, few but powerful, major Clans of the tribe.
republic_government_desc	The leaders of regular republics are randomly chosen from among the citizenry. This kind of republic is not playable, since there is no dynastic persistence between the generations of rulers.
tribal_government_desc	Tribes are settled but agrarian. Each county can only have one Tribal 'Holding', representing the entire local tribal population - the more empty Holding slots, the more powerful the Tribal Holding. Tribal rulers are limited to the 'Elective Gavelkind' Succession Law, which tends to fragment the realm between sons on the death of the chief.
theocracy_government_desc	Theocracies, like minor republics, are unplayable. Rulers are appointed or elected from among the ecclesiarchy, and there is no dynastic persistence between generations of rulers.

AIREASON_NO_WAR_AGAINST_SPOUSE	Will not join wars against spouse (§Y[GetTitledName]§!)!
HINT_NOMAD_VIEW_TEXT_1	Nomadic Tribes are always dominated by a number of major Clans. Keeping the clan chiefs in line - and balancing their number and power - should be a priority for any Khan. Have too few Clans, and one is likely to emerge by force if necessary. Have too many Clans, and they will be unhappy about lack of grazing land.
HINT_NOMAD_VIEW_TEXT_2	Each Clan has an opinion of every other Clan, called Clan Sentiments. The Clan chiefs must respect these sentiments, which is reflected in their normal Opinions of the other chiefs. Keep a careful eye on the Clan Sentiments to prevent internal strife before it happens.
HINT_NOMAD_VIEW_TEXT_3	Clans are always semi-autonomous and must be called to war even against a rebellion by another Clan. Worse, each Clan (even the ruling one) can only be allied to one other Clan, by swearing a Blood Oath. It is also common for Clans to be feuding, which allows them to war with each other for land. Positive or negative treatment of one Clan will also affect the Sentiments of any feuding or Blood Brother clan, as appropriate...
HINT_NOMAD_VIEW_TEXT_4	The key to managing the Clans is to use the special actions available to you - 'Split Clan', 'Settle Feud', etc.
