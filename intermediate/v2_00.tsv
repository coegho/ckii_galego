There has not been a Kohen Gadol  a High Priest of Judaism  since the Romans destroyed the Second Temple roughly a thousand years ago. At long last, this position has been filled and the High Priesthood reconstituted.\n\nLike the Jewish priests of ancient times, the Kohen Gadol was traditionally required to be a descendant of Aaron, the older brother of Moses. Due to a lack of suitable candidates this requirement has been waived, but the new High Priest still enjoys the respect of the Jewish religious communities, and the Priesthood has moved into and established itself at the Third Temple.
