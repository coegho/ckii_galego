As even the Holy Roman Emperor Friedrich II cowers in fear, the great invasion suddenly comes to an inexplicable halt as both Batu Khan of the Golden Horde and Hulagu Khan of the Ilkhanate return to Karakorum to elect a new Great Khan. In Northern Germany, the burghers of the Imperial Free Cities of Lübeck and Hamburg have just formed a trade alliance that will eventually become known as the Hanseatic League.
