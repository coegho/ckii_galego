EVTTITLE_HL_1001	The Wolf Child
EVTDESC_HL_1001	Little [From.GetFirstName] has been growing quickly. [From.GetSheHeCap] is alert and quick to learn, strong and healthy. [From.GetHerHisCap] voice is a little unusual, however, often descending to deep but playful growl. [From.GetSheHeCap] often sniffs around in an odd manner while looking for [From.GetHerHis] toys, and yes, [From.GetSheHe] is unusually hairy.\n\n[From.GetSheHeCap] has also several times bit [From.GetHerHis] nanny. But apart from that, everything is normal.
EVTOPTA_HL_1001	A fine little [From.GetBoyGirl]!
EVTOPTB_HL_1001	This is strange and worrying...
EVTDESC_HL_1010	You are out inspecting your lands, accompanied by your best soldiers. As you pass through a shallow gorge lined by low, windswept trees, you are suddenly alerted to an unusual sound. You order the column to halt and cock your head to listen. Yes, you hear it now, a thin wailing sound, as if from a puppy dog…\nYou spur your horse forward to try and locate the source of the sound, and soon you come upon a small cave. As you enter, bringing a light into the gloom within, you see a strange sight. A dead female wolf lies near the cave entrance, traces of disease plainly visible on her carcass. A small human child lies on a bed of grass and leaves near the wolf, wailing in a strange tone that seems almost animal-like to you in this strange place...
EVTOPTA_HL_1010	I shall take this child in as my own [New.GetSonDaughter].
EVTOPTB_HL_1010	I will have nothing to do with this!
EVTDESC_HL_1020	One day, playing outside by yourself, you notice suddenly that there is no one watching you, all the adults are busy. This being a perfect moment to go exploring undisturbed, you quickly sneak away and head for the wilds, where you aren’t normally allowed to go alone…\nA few hours later, you are lost. Hopelessly lost. As you sit down on a rock and begin to cry, you hear a strange sound behind you. As you turn around, you see a large gray wolf looking at you. She doesn’t seem threatening at all. After a few moments, you understand that she wants to help you find your home. You begin to run together, arriving swiftly to the point where the wolf dares not go closer to the human settlement. You wave to her and run home to tell your parents about this wonderful adventure.
EVTOPTA_HL_1020	What an exciting day!
EVTDESC_HL_1021	[From.GetFirstName] has been lost in the wilds all day. [From.GetSheHeCap] disappeared this morning and hasn’t been seen since. You sent people out looking but [From.GetSheHe] was nowhere to be found.\nJust as you are getting more and more worried, a happy cry is heard from outside. You look out and see [From.GetFirstName] skipping towards you with an almost euphoric smile on [From.GetHerHis] face. [From.GetSheHeCap] shouts: '[Root.GetFatherMotherCap]! I ran so very far away, and then I met a nice wolf and she was very friendly and then she helped me get home. It was wonderful!'
EVTOPTA_HL_1021	What a strange tale...
EVTOPTB_HL_1021	I should probably start keeping [From.GetHerHim] locked up.
EVTTITLE_HL_1030	[Root.GetSonDaughter] of the Wolf?
EVTDESC_HL_1030	For some time now, you have felt that people talk about you at court. There are conversations that stop as you enter the room, words spoken in hushed voices behind your back, furtive glances as you walk by. With time, you have managed to deduce certain things… you seem to generally be the subject of either curiosity, fear, envy, or a combination of any of the three.\n\nThe word that you most often hear repeated as you eavesdrop on the gossips is... wolf. Indeed, just the other day you heard someone speak a rumor that you’ve heard several times before - that you were born from a wolf mother...
EVTOPTA_HL_1030	Yes, I am a wolf! Raawr!
EVTOPTB_HL_1030	I'll teach them not to insult my mother!
EVTOPTC_HL_1030	They will never leave me alone!
EVTOPTD_HL_1030	These people don't deserve my attention.
EVTDESC_HL_1031	For some time now, you have heard people at court gossiping about your [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName]. There are conversations that stop as you enter the room, words spoken in hushed voices behind your back, furtive glances as you walk by. With time, you have managed to deduce certain things… [From.GetFirstName] seems to generally be the subject of either curiosity, fear, envy, or a combination of any of the three.\n\nThe word that you most often hear repeated as you eavesdrop on the gossips is... wolf. Indeed, just the other day you heard someone speak a rumor that you’ve heard several times before - that [From.GetHerHis] 'real' mother was a wolf...
EVTOPTA_HL_1031	I'm glad they call my [From.GetSonDaughter] a wolf!
EVTOPTB_HL_1031	I must put a stop to this talk.
EVTTITLE_HL_1040	Wolf's Blood
EVTDESC_HL_1040	As time passes, the years change but other things stay the same. Somehow, you know the blood of a wolf runs in your veins. This knowledge strengthens you, though sometimes it makes you wonder who you really are...
EVTOPTA_HL_1040	My future is still to be forged.
EVTDESC_HL_1041	Your [From.GetSonDaughter] [From.GetFirstName] has become an adult. The strangeness, [From.GetHerHis] unusual wolf-like character, remains however. Perhaps it has even become more pronounced with time..
EVTOPTA_HL_1041	I hope it shall be a blessing and not a curse.
EVTTITLE_HL_1100	Wolves
EVTDESC_HL_1100	On the hunt, you keep seeing a group of wolves from time to time. They only seem to appear when you are alone or when no one else is looking, however. It all has a strange exhilarating effect on you, making your blood run quicker and drawing out your hunting instincts.
EVTOPTA_HL_1100	The hunt! I feel so alive!
EVTTITLE_HL_1200	Deep in the Night
EVTDESC_HL_1200	For several nights now, you have been unable to sleep well. It usually starts at midnight - the howling of wolves outside. You toss and turn and sometimes go back to sleep, but the howling doesn’t stop until late in the morning. And even then, as the silence falls, you miss the sound of the canine voices on the wind. You feel restless...

EVTTITLE_HL_1201	Call of the Wolves
EVTDESC_HL_1201	It never stops. Night after night, the wolves keep howling outside. No one is sleeping well, but you are probably the one suffering more than anyone. Not only does the howling prevent you from sleeping, but when it stops you can’t stop thinking about it, waiting for it to come back...
EVTOPTA_HL_1201	I’ll go out and meet these wolves, alone.
EVTOPTB_HL_1201	I’ll go out, bringing guards.
EVTOPTC_HL_1201	I’ll wait - surely, this madness will stop soon.
wolves_go_out_alone_tooltip	A wolf among wolves.
wolves_go_out_with_guards_tooltip	A large group of armed and armored men set out.
wolves_ignore_tooltip	You ignore the wolves from now on.
EVTTITLE_HL_1202	Hesitation
EVTDESC_HL_1202	You go out into the night to meet the howling wolves, approaching a nearby hill where they seem to have gathered. As you and your guards draw closer, the wolves draw back slightly, showing a certain nervousness.
EVTOPTA_HL_1202	Guards - leave me to meet these beasts alone.
wolves_continue_alone_tooltip	You press forward to meet the beasts alone.
EVTOPTB_HL_1202	This is pointless - let’s go back.
EVTTITLE_HL_1203	Something is missing
EVTDESC_HL_1203	The wolves have finally stopped their nightly howling outside your home, and there has been silence at night for almost two weeks now. Everyone at your court is relieved, saying they sleep better. Everyone except you... you find that there is a void in your soul, something missing now. You often dream of the wolves howling, and sometimes in your dreams you are running with them through the night, only to wake up early in the morning with a feeling of emptiness.
EVTOPTA_HL_1203	Who am I?
EVTTITLE_HL_1210	The Wolfpack
EVTDESC_HL_1210	As you carefully approach the wolves, alone, they stand and wait for you, absolutely still. It turns out to be a pack of about a dozen. As you reach them, they approach you, one by one, smelling you and nudging you with their noses, growling softly. A feeling of belonging wells up inside you, and you feel a quickening throughout your entire body. After a few moments, the wolves begin to move, beckoning you to join them, and you start to jog, breaking into a run. Soon, you are running at full speed, following the pack of wolves into the wild...
EVTOPTA_HL_1210	Raaaawr!
wolves_run_with_wolves_tooltip	You join the wolfpack.
EVTTITLE_HL_1230	The Wolves Hunt
EVTDESC_HL_1230	You have been running with the wolves for a while now. Keeping up with their pace exerts you to near your physical limits, but it also makes you feel strong and alive. You stop occasionally to rest and to drink the cold water of small streams in the wild.\n\nEventually hunger sets in, and you hunt. The pack works in a perfectly coordinated way, cornering a large deer and slaying it. The time has come to feast!
EVTOPTA_HL_1230	Rip, tear, devour!
EVTOPTB_HL_1230	Raw meat? Very well, only because I'm so hungry...
EVTTITLE_HL_1240	A farewell
EVTDESC_HL_1240	You have spent a long time out in the wild with the wolfpack now, losing track of the days. The wolves treat you as one of their own. You’ve always felt the coursing of the wolf blood in your veins, but never as strong as now. You start to realize, however, that you have a home to return to, domains to oversee and envious relatives that might covet your position. Reluctantly, you decide that it’s time to return home.
EVTOPTA_HL_1240	We will meet again!
EVTTITLE_HL_1250	The Homecoming
EVTDESCA_HL_1250	You’ve returned after spending several days out in the wild, running with the wolves. As you appear at court, people stare in awed silence. Your clothes are torn and full of dirt, leaves and blood. Your hair is disheveled and your face has scratches from branches and form the loving attentions of your packmates. But what perhaps impresses your subjects the most is the wide wolfish grin on your face.\n\nYour servants come to meet you, abject and impressed but also clearly trying to hide their fear and worry. Everyone is wondering where you've been.
EVTDESCB_HL_1250	You’ve returned after spending several days out in the wild, running with the wolves. As you appear at court, people stare in awed silence. Your clothes are torn and full of dirt, leaves and blood. Your hair is disheveled and your face has scratches from branches and form the loving attentions of your packmates. But what perhaps impresses your subjects the most is the wide wolfish grin on your face.\n\n[wolf_worried_homecoming.GetName] rushes out to meet you, fussing over you and asking where you’ve been.
EVTOPTA_HL_1250	It's my own business.
EVTOPTB_HL_1250	Everything will be different now.
EVTOPTC_HL_1250	I was thinking of you all the time.
lycanthropy	Werewolf
lycanthropy_desc	Strange things happen around this character on some full moons.
EVTTITLE_HL_1400	The Werewolf
EVTDESC_HL_1400	You’ve been nervous for the last couple of nights, sleeping restlessly, feeling a strange pull on your mind. During the days you have been tired, but also tense with anticipation, sensing something important arriving.\n\nNow, at night, as you wake and see the full moon rise, you finally understand. It’s the moon, it speaks to you, it is time to rise, time to become the wolf, time to go out, time to be free, time to lose your mind to the moon-madness...
EVTTITLE_HL_1401	Full Moon
EVTDESC_HL_1401	The moon has been growing full during the past couple of nights, and with your restlessness is growing. You can sense it coming. It is time again, time to embrace the moon-madness...
EVTOPTA_HL_1401	What will the night bring?
EVTDESC_HL_1410	You run through the night, until you reach the highest hill in sight. You spend hours and hours howling at the moon, exulting in her light and in your madness.
EVTDESC_HL_1420	You run through the night, far and farther still, the moon-madness driving you. You jump ditches, climb hills and swim small rivers. You run and run until you are exhausted, then lay down to sleep on the soft ground. Just to rest a little...
EVTOPTA_HL_1420	So good but so tiring...
EVTDESC_HL_1430	You run through the night, seeking prey. You eventually find it, and you pounce. Tearing, slashing, gouging, all the while howling like the wolf you are. In the end the panicked mooing stops...
EVTOPTA_HL_1430	Blood!
EVTDESC_HL_1440	You run through the night, seeking prey. You eventually find it, and you pounce. Tearing, slashing, gouging, all the while howling like the wolf you are. In the end the panicked squealing stops...

EVTTITLE_HL_1490	The Morning After
EVTDESCA_HL_1490	You wake in the morning, but you feel as though you hadn’t slept at all. Your muscles ache, and your throat is sore. As you try to speak, you realize that you are quite hoarse. How could that be? You don’t remember.
EVTDESCB_HL_1490	You wake in the morning, but you feel as though you hadn’t slept at all. You vaguely remember having nightmares. You are cold as well, and wet. What happened during the night? You don’t remember at all.
EVTDESCC_HL_1490	You wake in the morning, but you feel as though you hadn’t slept at all. You vaguely remember having nightmares. You seem to have something wet and sticky on your chest. As you look down, you realize that you are covered in blood. It’s clearly not yours, and you don’t remember how it got there. There is something about it, however, that awakens a vague exhilaration in you...
EVTOPTA_HL_1490	Strange.
hoarse	Hoarse
hoarse_desc	This character has overexerted [GetHerHis] voice and can hardly speak.
werewolf_killed	Full Moon Fever
werewolf_killed_desc	This character recently drew blood under the full moon.
EVTDESC_HL_1500	The blood and spirit of the wolf is within you. You feel it as you walk among the people - you are not like them, you are superior. And the air is fragrant with the smell of meat, it is all around you. It could all be yours for the taking, if you are careful...
EVTOPTA_HL_1500	The wolf is hungry!
EVTOPTB_HL_1500	I... must... resist... it...
EVTDESC_HL_1510	The moon is high in the night sky. She casts her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, sensing a strange longing. Your wolf’s blood runs quicker, the moon beckons. You raise your voice in tribute to her...
EVTOPTA_HL_1510	Aoooouuuuuuuu!!!
EVTDESC_HL_1520	One night at dinner, you accidentally drop a piece of meat on the floor. A small dog runs up and snatches it before you can grab it. Enraged, without thinking, you draw your sword and jump at the dog, skewering it. [wolf_hunting_instinct_at_court_courtier.GetTitledName] is horrified, as you have just killed [wolf_hunting_instinct_at_court_courtier.GetHerHis] favorite dog.
EVTOPTA_HL_1520	No one touches my meat.
EVTDESC_HL_1530	In your daily martial training and discussions on military matters with your commanders, you find that there are often moves and tactics that occur to no one else but you. People seem to be impressed by your instinctive understanding of encirclement tactics, trickery and stealth.
EVTOPTA_HL_1530	The wolves always catch their prey.
EVTDESC_HL_1540	You often run and wrestle to keep fit. It is a hunger and desire for the hunt that drives you, and you often see the movement patterns of wolves before your inner eye as you train.
EVTOPTA_HL_1540	I feel strong!
EVTDESC_HL_1550	You consider yourself a clever person, effectively applying your mind to any problem that needs solving. You have found that true strength comes when the animal cunning of the wolf is added to the human intellect.
EVTOPTA_HL_1550	Few have it.
EVTDESC_HL_1560	Lately, you have been feeling a strange wolfish hunger as you look at some members of your court. You have been taught to control your desires like everyone else, but there is a deep animal instinct within you that keeps increasing in intensity, pressing more and more on your patience. You feel it will soon no longer be possible to control it - and perhaps you don’t want to?
EVTOPTA_HL_1560	Growl.
EVTOPTB_HL_1560	It's like an animal inside me!
EVTOPTC_HL_1560	I smell new smells...
EVTDESC_HL_1570	The lone wolf will not survive, and prosperity is only possible when the pack hunts together as one. You know this, and you feel a deep need to include everyone and thus make your court stronger.
EVTOPTA_HL_1570	I almost licked someone today.
EVTOPTB_HL_1570	I have a new sense of... belonging.
EVTDESC_HL_1580	The prey starts and flees at the slightest sound. The prey is fearful. The wolf goes forth without fear, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will be the one to eat and not be eaten, knowing [Root.GetSheHe] will prevail.
EVTOPTA_HL_1580	I am the wolf.
EVTOPTB_HL_1580	I see it now.
EVTDESC_HL_1590	The strongest are the ones who survive. The weak shall perish, such is the law of the steppe. And on the steppe, the wolf is strongest.
EVTOPTA_HL_1590	The law must be respected.
EVTOPTB_HL_1590	I did not see it before.
EVTDESC_HL_1610	There is a rage that strikes you sometimes. They say your ancestors were wolves, and maybe they are right.
EVTOPTA_HL_1610	Let the wolf rage.
EVTOPTB_HL_1610	I cannot stop it!
EVTDESC_HL_1620	Occasionally, as you look into a mirror, it occurs to you that your face more and more resembles that of a wolf. It seems to be a slow but inexorable change occurring over the years. You can’t quite decide if you like it or not, but you sense that people at court have started to look at you in a funny way.
EVTOPTA_HL_1620	There is nothing I can do about it.
EVTOPTB_HL_1620	And they used to think me fair...
EVTDESC_HL_1630	Sometimes when you sit down to reason and try to straighten out a problem, your mind only bends back in on itself. Your almost seem to forget your learning as animal instincts take over, seeking solutions that are more simple and direct.
EVTOPTA_HL_1630	Maybe instinct is better than learning.
EVTDESC_HL_1640	The moon is high in the night sky. She casts Her light over the lands, illuminating the night. You turn your gaze skywards, basking in Her radiant love. Your wolf’s blood runs quicker as She beckons to you. You slowly raise your voice in tribute to Her, howling as you would howl until the world ends. It fills you with joy, and you exult in Her being, knowing that She and you are one!
EVTTITLE_HL_1702	Wolf's Legacy
EVTDESCA_HL_1702	Little [From.GetFirstName] is not like most other children. You notice that [From.GetSheHe] growls when other children cry, and is quicker and stronger than other children [From.GetHerHis] age. There is also that sniffing thing [From.GetSheHe] does. You recognize the signs - [From.GetSheHe] has inherited your blood, the blood of wolves...
EVTDESCB_HL_1702	Little [From.GetFirstName] is not like most other children. You notice that [From.GetSheHe] growls when other children cry, and is quicker and stronger than other children [From.GetHerHis] age. There is also that sniffing thing [From.GetSheHe] does. If you didn’t know better, you’d say [From.GetSheHe] has inherited [From.GetHerHis] [Spouse.GetFatherMother]’s blood, the blood of wolves...
EVTOPTA_HL_1702	[From.GetSheHeCap] will grow to be a strong [From.GetManWoman]!

EVTNAME_HL_8008	A Lone Hermit
EVTDESC_HL_8008	On your way to the mountains, you encounter a lonely hermit. He doesn't own much besides a worn down tent, an old and sick horse, along with a few sheep. But the old man invites you to drink some salted tea with him. As you talk, you realize that you are enjoying his company!
EVTOPTA_HL_8008	Here. Take this.
EVTOPTB_HL_8008	Why don't you join us?
EVTOPTC_HL_8008	Thank you, but I must be going.
EVTNAME_HL_8010	Sky Burial
EVTDESC_HL_8010	After reaching the mountains, you carefully place the body in what you deem a good location. You can already hear the vultures soaring above as you perform the necessary rituals. When you start to make your way back down, it doesn't take long until the vultures begin to tear at the flesh with both beak and claw.
EVTOPTA_HL_8010	You are with [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName] now.
EVTNAME_HL_8011	Being Followed
EVTDESC_HL_8011	Ever since you left the mountains, you have had the odd feeling that someone is following you. But when you turn to look, there is nothing there. But as you reach the top of a small hill, you quickly turn your head and see that one of the vultures has been following you! And not just any vulture. It's a bearded vulture!
EVTOPTA_HL_8011	Can I keep it?!
EVTOPTB_HL_8011	Just scare it away.
EVTNAME_HL_8020	Constructing Tomb

You make sure to properly seal and cover the tomb, taking extra caution to make sure that no markings reveals its location. You kill all the workers so that no one but you, and your personal guard, know where to find it.
EVTOPTA_HL_8022	Magnificent, and no one shall ever disturb it.
EVTOPTB_HL_8022	Have the guards killed as well.
EVTNAME_HL_8030	The Gobi Desert
EVTDESC_HL_8030	The days have been agonizingly warm. Your water has almost run out. The body has already started to decompose and can be smelled from quite the distance. Yet, you haven't reached the place where the death worm is rumored to exist. The others of your party beg you to go back.
EVTOPTA_HL_8030	Nonsense! We must continue!
EVTOPTB_HL_8030	This was a bad idea.. Lets go back..
