I laughed in his face and he challenged me, even though I bore a sword and he nothing but a wooden staff.
EVTNAME10026	A stranger suspicious	Easy as pie!
EVTDESC10026	In the heat of battle, I somehow revealed to the green-clad man who I was. I tried to parry his fierce blows but I was too slow. I heard rather than felt the staff smash into my skull. When I woke up my sword, purse and opponent were long gone.	You win the fight
EVTOPTA10026	Now I will never catch him, nor the Merry Men!	You lose the fight
EVTNAME10030	Meet the Merry Men	Your real identity is revealed
EVTDESC10030	As I approached their hideout, songs, laughter and people talking reached my ears. It was more a small village hiding beneath and up in the trees rather than a lawless gang's lair. Women cooked, tended to children and babbled with the men who practiced their skills with bows and swords. A woman clothed in green and as skilled as any man with a bow caught my eye but before I could approach her, I was introduced to their leader who seemed restless and asked me hundreds of questions. In order to gain their trust, I had to prove myself to him and his gang.	If I promise to never return, will you let me go then?
EVTOPTA10030	Really?	A stranger defeated
EVTTOOLTIP10031	Steal from the rich and give to the poor	It did not seem fair to fight the man with a sword when he had a wooden staff, so I carved myself a staff before we commenced. After receiving several blows, I dodged his attack and drove the tip of my staff into his left side and as he doubled up, I hit him with all my strength. With a sigh he lost consciousness and fell into the creek. I feared he might drown so I poked at him with my staff. With a roar he exploded out of the river and up on the embankment. He grumpily admitted defeat after some persuasion and with a grimace and a limp he took me to his lawless brothers.
EVTOPTB10030	Let's see what adventure we can find	As I said, easy as pie!
EVTTOOLTIP10032	Adventure ahead!	A stranger victorious
EVTOPTC10030	This is enough!	I carved myself a wooden staff as it did not seem fair to use a sword against a man armed only with a staff. We exchanged blows and he was both stronger and faster than I had thought him to be. He did not seem to tire and when I lowered my staff to admit defeat, he delivered a hard blow that sent me over the bridge and into the muddy water. Roaring with laughter, he helped me get up on the bridge and slapped me so hard I coughed up the last mouthful of water I had swallowed. He insisted I would follow him and meet his gang.
EVTTOOLTIP10040	Arrest the leader of the Merry Men	I couldn't say no to him
EVTOPTD10026	This is as far as I dare take it	A stranger suspicious
EVTNAME10031	Steal from the rich	In the heat of battle, I somehow revealed to the green-clad man who I was. I tried to parry his fierce blows but I was too slow. I heard rather than felt the staff smash into my skull. When I woke up my sword, purse and opponent were long gone.
EVTDESC10031	Praying he would not recognize me, I stepped out in front of my old friend and demanded he would surrender his purse. The way he looked at me, disgust mixed with fear, could only mean he did not recognize me. I had to threaten to kill him to make him let go of the purse, and I made a silent vow to try and compensate him should I be able to ever return to my castle. His purse was heavy and so was my heart as I returned to the bandit leader.	Now I will never catch him, nor the Merry Men!
EVTOPTA10031	This has gone too far!	Meet the Merry Men
EVTOPTB10031	Time to leave	As I approached their hideout, songs, laughter and people talking reached my ears. It was more a small village hiding beneath and up in the trees rather than a lawless gang's lair. Women cooked, tended to children and babbled with the men who practiced their skills with bows and swords.

In order to gain their trust, I had to prove myself to him and his gang.
EVTOPTC10031	Now I know where to find them	Really?
EVTTOOLTIP10041	Betray the Merry Men	Steal from the rich and give to the poor
EVTNAME10032	Adventure!	Let's see what adventure we can find
EVTDESC10032	I insisted that the leader and I would go looking for adventure together, without any of the other Merry Men. They grumbled a bit but was silenced by the leader who thought it to be an excellent idea. As we walked down the road, we saw a man clad in horse-skin leaning against a tree. I wanted to confront the horse-man myself but the stubborn leader did not listen. While he talked to horse-man, I was attacked and tied to a tree by one of my own sheriffs! The leader of the Merry Men returned, saw me tied to the tree and killed my sheriff before he cut my ropes.	Adventure ahead!
EVTOPTA10032	This has gone too far!	This is enough!
EVTOPTB10032	Now what?	Arrest the leader of the Merry Men
EVTOPTC10032	This was... fun?	This is as far as I dare take it
EVTTOOLTIP10033	Leave the Merry Men	Steal from the rich
EVTOPTD10032	Time to leave and leave them alone	Praying he would not recognize me, I stepped out in front of my old friend and demanded he would surrender his purse.

EVTNAME10033	Leave the Merry Men	This has gone too far!
EVTDESC10033	I slunk away from the Merry Men after having had adventures, venison and flirted with the green-clad maid. I had great fun together with the outlaws and feel no need to try and change their ways, as long as their shenanigans do not affect me. They seemed rather harmless, content to hide in their forest and occasionally robbing someone who will not suffer from losing a little gold.	Time to leave
EVTOPTA10033	Fare thee well!	Now I know where to find them
EVTNAME10040	Time to make a decision	Betray the Merry Men
EVTDESC10040	What should I do about the green-clad Merry Men and their leader?	Adventure!
EVTOPTA10040	I'll hang them!	I insisted that the leader and I would go looking for adventure together, without any of the other Merry Men.

EVTOPTB10040	I'll hire them as gamekeepers	This has gone too far!
EVTNAME10041	Ambush!	Now what?
EVTDESC10041	When the snores of the Merry Men echoed throughout the forest, I snuck back home and rallied my troops. I led them straight to the band of robbers and thieves. We caught every one of the bandits, the women and children were spared and set free.	This was... fun?
EVTOPTA10041	Kill them all!	Leave the Merry Men
EVTOPTB10041	If their leader becomes my gamekeeper I will spare their lives	Time to leave and leave them alone
EVTTOOLTIP10042	The wedding between lady Marion and Robin	Leave the Merry Men
EVTNAME10042	The Wedding	I slunk away from the Merry Men after having had adventures, venison and flirted with the green-clad maid. I had great fun together with the outlaws and feel no need to try and change their ways, as long as their shenanigans do not affect me. They seemed rather harmless, content to hide in their forest and occasionally robbing someone who will not suffer from losing a little gold.
EVTDESC10042	The wedding between lady Marion and Robin was held in the forest, venison was served at the wedding feast but I let it slip, for now. The bridal couple had only eyes for each other and when the fat monk started playing a slow, beautiful song about love they joined hands and danced, still gazing into each other eyes. They did not even notice when the song turned faster and the rest of the dancers followed the rhythm, but continued dancing slowly until the stars started sparkling on the clear sky.	Fare thee well!
EVTOPTA10042	I wish them good luck with all my heart	Time to make a decision
