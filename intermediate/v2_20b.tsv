EVTDESC107303	It appears you don't have enough ships to transport the Army. Sometimes when you're at War, the Levies from your Demesne and your Vassals might not be enough. In these cases it is wise to hire Mercenaries. This can be done via the Mercenaries Tab in the Military View. Newly hired Mercenaries arrive in your capital County. They are very expensive, both to hire and maintain. Take a look at the mercenary composition before you hire them. Some are made entirely out of Armies while others consist only of Fleets. Hire some naval mercs! They will spawn in a Sea Area West of your Realm.	It appears you don't have enough ships to transport the Army.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_3040	Alp Arslan, great-grandson of Seljuk, was born Muhammad bin Dawud Chaghri, but his strength, personal combat skills and valor were soon to earn him his honorary name, which means 'Heroic Lion'. Early on, he succeeded his father as governor of Khorasan, and after a succession crisis in 1064 he took the title of Sultan by force of arms, and became ruler of the immense Seljuk Empire. He then made war on the Byzantine Empire, defeating them thoroughly at the famous battle of Manzikert and taking the Emperor prisoner. This victory was a first step towards Turkish domination in Anatolia and was one of the major events triggering the crusades. He died true to his name, at the age of 42, refusing to let his guards help him against a rebel prisoner who came at him with a dagger.

ERA_CHAR_INFO_167219	The Hanseatic League was a loose alliance of German cities centered on Lübeck that dominated Baltic trade in the late Middle Ages and beyond, after displacing Visby as the leading merchant power in the region. Offices, so-called 'kontors,' were opened in major ports and trading hubs everywhere from London in the west to Novgorod in the east. Eventually the League became powerful enough to challenge larger realms directly, such as when they sacked the Danish capital of Copenhagen in the second half of the 14th century.

His reign was marked with frequent wars against the Papacy, and Friedrich was excommunicated four times - Pope Gregory IX even dubbed him the Antichrist. He managed to broker the return of Jerusalem to Christian control during the Sixth Crusade despite taking part in very little actual fighting. After dying of dysentry in 1250 at the age of 55, his line would quickly die out, resulting in the end of the House of Hohenstaufen.
