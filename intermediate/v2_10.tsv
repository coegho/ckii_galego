You wade and swim back and forth, searching for hours, but it's useless, you just can't find it.	The riders you sent after the diamond return. They explain that the merchant who bought the jewel refused to sell it back, and when they insisted a fight broke out. The merchant has been killed but your men managed to retreive the diamond. As things turned out, you got to keep your money as well...
EVTOPTA_RoI_244	It's gone!	I will sleep with it under my pillow.
EVTDESC_RoI_245	One morning when you wake up, you realize that your precious diamond is gone! Someone has stolen it while you were sleeping, from your very bedchamber.	Diamond thief
EVTOPTA_RoI_245	It must have been my wife!	You threw the magnificent diamond in the river, but now you miss it terribly. Perhaps it'd still be possible to find if you went and looked?
EVTOPTB_RoI_245	It must have been my own blood who did it!	It's not too late to correct my mistake. We will search for it!
EVTOPTC_RoI_245	I know it was someone on my council!	Leave it be.
EVTDESC_RoI_247	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is very upset at your accusation. You hold [From.GetHerHim] in the dungeon while [From.GetHerHim] quarters are searched, but nothing is found. After a while, you start to doubt - perhaps you were mistaken in your suspicion?	You send your men to search the river where you threw the diamond in, but to no avail. Frustrated, you dive in yourself. You wade and swim back and forth, searching for hours, but it's useless, you just can't find it.
EVTOPTA_RoI_247	It seems to me that [From.GetSheHe] is innocent.	It's gone!
EVTOPTB_RoI_247	No, [From.GetSheHe] must be guilty - execute [From.GetHerHim]!	One morning when you wake up, you realize that your precious diamond is gone! Someone has stolen it while you were sleeping, from your very bedchamber.
thugs_rampant	Strange disappearances...	It must have been my wife!
EVTDESC_RoI_147	My [Root.GetLordLady], there is a mysterious plague on our province of [From.GetName]. Many travellers and caravans have been disappearing, much more than would be a normal toll of robbers, accidents and disease.	It must have been my own blood who did it!
EVTOPTA_RoI_147	We should investigate.	I know it was someone on my council!
EVTOPTB_RoI_147	The sufferings of commoners are nothing to me.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is very upset at your accusation. You hold [From.GetHerHim] in the dungeon while [From.GetHerHim] quarters are searched, but nothing is found. After a while, you start to doubt - perhaps you were mistaken in your suspicion?
EVTDESC_RoI_148	The agents that we sent out to investigate the unknown menace on the roads have disappeared without trace. We haven't heard from them in months.	It seems to me that [From.GetSheHe] is innocent.
EVTOPTA_RoI_148	We must continue our investigations. But send larger, armed parties.	No, [From.GetSheHe] must be guilty - execute [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTB_RoI_148	Burn farms and hang peasants until the truth comes out.	Strange disappearances...
EVTOPTC_RoI_148	Give up, this is clearly hopeless.	My [Root.GetLordLady], there is a mysterious plague on our province of [From.GetName]. Many travellers and caravans have been disappearing, much more than would be a normal toll of robbers, accidents and disease.
EVTDESC_RoI_149	We have spread much terror and woe in the countryside, my [Root.GetLordLady], and the peasants now seem sufficiently cowed. However, there is no new information on the mysterious disappearances. It would seem that the peasants really know nothing about it.	We should investigate.
EVTOPTA_RoI_149	Pay them some compensation. We shall try another strategy.	The sufferings of commoners are nothing to me.
EVTOPTB_RoI_149	No one is wholly innocent. Now let's forget this matter.	The agents that we sent out to investigate the unknown menace on the roads have disappeared without trace. We haven't heard from them in months.
EVTDESC_RoI_150	My [Root.GetLordLady], the problem of the disappearing caravans persists. Perhaps we should try sending large parties of soldiers to scout after all?	We must continue our investigations. But send larger, armed parties.
EVTOPTA_RoI_150	Very well, send out armed riders.	Burn farms and hang peasants until the truth comes out.
EVTOPTB_RoI_150	No, we will offer a large money reward for information.	Give up, this is clearly hopeless.
EVTDESC_RoI_151	A young traveller has come forward, claiming he has important information about the disappearing caravans. He says he wants the gold reward, but asks to see you personally.	We have spread much terror and woe in the countryside, my [Root.GetLordLady], and the peasants now seem sufficiently cowed. However, there is no new information on the mysterious disappearances. It would seem that the peasants really know nothing about it.
EVTOPTA_RoI_151	Very well, admit him.	Pay them some compensation. We shall try another strategy.
EVTNAME_RoI_152	A visitor...	No one is wholly innocent. Now let's forget this matter.
EVTDESC_RoI_152	The young man enters the throne room, looking around cautiously. He looks up and says he has brought good information, then reaches inside his jacket. He pulls out... a throwing knife! He throws it at you, shouting: 'Our Mother Kali will harvest what is hers!' [From.GetFullName] reacts and throws [From.GetHerselfHimself] in front of you, saving your life but sacrificing [From.GetHerHis] own, with a knife through the heart. The strange youth quickly escapes, running past the surprised guards.	My [Root.GetLordLady], the problem of the disappearing caravans persists. Perhaps we should try sending large parties of soldiers to scout after all?
EVTOPTA_RoI_152	[From.GetTitledFirstName] saved me from the assassin!	Very well, send out armed riders.
EVTDESC_RoI_153	A council is held after the assassination attempt. Your advisors all agree that this menace must be dealt with forcefully.	No, we will offer a large money reward for information.
EVTOPTA_RoI_153	Yes, send out the troops.	A young traveller has come forward, claiming he has important information about the disappearing caravans. He says he wants the gold reward, but asks to see you personally.
EVTOPTB_RoI_153	No, this is too dangerous. Leave it be.	Very well, admit him.
EVTDESC_RoI_155	Your riders have still not been able to find any clues regarding the attacks, though at least the caravans they accompany in strength are safe. Also, it has been noted that short-range caravans seem to never be attacked in the same way, only the longer-travelling ones. Strange.	A visitor...
EVTOPTA_RoI_155	Supply military escort to all long range caravans in the province.	The young man enters the throne room, looking around cautiously. He looks up and says he has brought good information, then reaches inside his jacket. He pulls out... a throwing knife! He throws it at you, shouting 
EVTOPTB_RoI_155	Give it up, this takes up too many resources.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] saved me from the assassin!
EVTDESC_RoI_156	Several months have passed since you ordered large military escorts for all long-range caravans in the province of [From.GetName]. In this time, no caravans have disappeared. Travellers and merchants can once again breathe easily. It still irks you that you will never know who did it. There are rumours, however, of an increased number of disappeared caravans in several neighboring provinces...	A council is held after the assassination attempt. Your advisors all agree that this menace must be dealt with forcefully.
EVTOPTA_RoI_156	It's not my problem anymore.	Yes, send out the troops.
EVTDESC_RoI_157	A delegation from your subjects has arrived. Large-scale forest clearing work is being done in one of your provinces. Recent illness among the elephants means the peasants don't have enough of the animals to be able to finish in time before the rainy season. They ask you to lend them elephants to speed up the work.	No, this is too dangerous. Leave it be.
EVTOPTA_RoI_157	I will send elephants.	Your riders have still not been able to find any clues regarding the attacks, though at least the caravans they accompany in strength are safe. Also, it has been noted that short-range caravans seem to never be attacked in the same way, only the longer-travelling ones. Strange.
EVTOPTB_RoI_157	I can't spare my elephants, but I will send soldiers to help.	Supply military escort to all long range caravans in the province.
EVTOPTC_RoI_157	Your problems are not my concern.	Give it up, this takes up too many resources.
