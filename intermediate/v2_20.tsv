The earlier part of this era saw the great Germanic and Slavic migrations across Europe, with peoples such as the Goths and Lombards settling in Southern Europe, the Franks settling in Gaul and Saxons crossing the sea and settling in Britain. The Eastern Roman Empire was violently shaken by the pressure from the Goths and Avars, and fought bitterly with the ancient Persian enemy. The rise of Islam saw the Arabs conquering immense amounts of territory in the Middle East and North Africa, and in India several great dynasties vied for dominance, with the Rashtrakutas rising towards the end of the 8th century. In the steppes, the Khazars grew in power, and in Scandinavia things were about to change in a way that was to affect the entire continent...

LATE_MED_INFO	Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring...

ERA_CHAR_INFO_6392	Son of Pepin the Short and a descendant of Charles Martel, Charlemagne (or Karl, as his contemporaries called him) became joint king of the Franks with his brother Karloman in 769. After a two-year power struggle, Karloman suddenly and conveniently fell ill and died, leaving Karl as sole ruler of the Franks.  He then proceeded to make the kingdom greater than ever before, conquering Saxony, Lombardy and other lands with equal measures of good strategic planning and ruthlessness. He was eventually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by pope Leo III, and his descendants were to rule large parts of Europe for a long time to come.

He died unexpectedly in 771, just as war for the Frankish crown seemed inevitable. It has been claimed that he was poisoned, but this was never proven...

He spent several years in exile before arriving in Spain, where he managed to seize power and declare himself ruler of Al-Andalus. He wanted to return east and avenge himself on the Abbasids, but the need to deal with issues closer to home kept preventing him from doing so. He instead set his mark on the history of Spain, establishing the rule of his dynasty there for centuries to come.
