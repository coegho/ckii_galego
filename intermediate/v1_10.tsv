HOLY_SITES_LESS	Does NOT control at least §Y$VAL$§W holy sites\n	Welcome to The Old Gods!
HOLY_SITES_LEAST	Controls at least §Y$VAL$§W holy sites\n	Playing as a Pagan in 'The Old Gods' is quite different from playing as a Christian or Muslim ruler. This Hint screen will explain the fundamentals of pagan gameplay, which is useful to know even for Crusader Kings II veterans.
MAJOR_RIVER_SHORT	Crossing of the Major River §Y$RIVER$§! to §Y$TO$§!	Conquest is much easier for pagan rulers - you can subjugate all other pagans and conquer neigbouring counties at will. The seafaring Norse have the added option of taking any coastal county, and can declare 'Prepared Invasions' in which restless bands of adventurers may join the ranks in hopes of plunder and glory.\nTake care, however, for keeping your realm together is far more difficult for Pagans - vassals are more likely to join independence factions, and can win such wars easier. Pagan vassals are also more sceptical of new rulers, which can cause problems until you prove yourself worthy. Pagan realms are prone to grow quickly and then break apart as generations pass.
MAJOR_RIVER_DESC	When attacking over a Major River, the attacking army will get a significant combat penalty	Pagans are not as centralized as Christian and Muslim rulers and are therefore limited to low Crown Authority and the Gavelkind succession law.\nHowever, a powerful and pious Pagan ruler who controls enough Holy Sites can Reform their religion so that it is better able to compete with the monotheistic faiths.\nThe reformer creates or becomes the new religious head of the reformed religion, and all faithful rulers gain the ability to wage Holy Wars. The restrictions on Crown Authority and Succession Laws are lifted and it becomes easier to manage large realms - independence factions will be less potent and vassals will be more accepting of the new ruler on succession.
RETCAP_FROM_REALM	From Realm: §G$REALM$§!\n   Holdings: §Y$HOLDINGS$§!\n   Cap per Holding: §Y$PERHOLDING$§!\n	As a Pagan male, you are able to take up to 3 Concubines in addition to your wife. However, these women will not add to your stats or provide alliances. You can gain Concubines through diplomacy or by simply taking any imprisoned woman as your Concubine.
RETCAP_FROM_BUILDINGS	From Buildings: §G$AMOUNT$§!\n	The Christians and Muslims are a constant threat to Pagans - they are more stable and can wage Holy Wars on you. However, all Pagans except the Tengri have a great defensive advantage: non-pagans take significant attrition damage in pagan lands. Alas, this effect does not last forever though - if the Pagan religion is reformed or if the attacker has a high enough technological level, the advantage is lost.
RETCAP_FROM_TECH	From Technology: §G+$PERCENT$%§!\n	The Pagan religions can be roughly sorted into two groups: Offensive (Tengri, Norse) and Defensive (Suomenusko, West African, Romuva, Slavic).
RETCAP_MINIMUM_RETINUE	Minimum Retinue: §Y$MIN$§!\n	The Offensive Pagans:\nAll Offensive Pagans lose Prestige when they have not been at war for some time, but they also never have a shortage of CBs to use on all those around them. Alternatively, they can go looting!
RETCAP_FROM_RELIGION	From Religion: $AMOUNT$\n	To loot, select an army and click on the 'Toggle Looter' button. Move the army to the lands of someone not of your religion to have them start looting. This will make you hostile toward the owner of the county and all his lieges, so beware of their troops.\nIf you are looting a county neighbouring your own lands, the loot will go straight into your coffers. Otherwise, you need a fleet in an adjacent sea zone. The loot will be loaded onto the ships, and will then need to be transported back to the homeland, so plan accordingly.\nThis means that only coastal counties and those next to your land can be looted. If you are Norse however, you have another option - your ships can navigate the major rivers of Europe, opening up more areas for raiding.
RETCAP_TOTAL	\nTotal: §Y$TOTAL$§!	The Norse also have the ability to do Prepared Invasions. After declaring their intention to invade an enemy, landless adventurers may flock to their banners. These extra troops will allow smaller Norse realms to take on larger enemies, making them even more dangerous to the Christian and Muslim world. However, both attacker and defender need to be of reasonable size and a ruler can only attempt one prepared invasion in his lifetime.
RAISE_COUNTY_LEVIES	Raise County Levies	The Defensive Pagans:\nThese Pagans are not quite as aggressive as the Norse and the Tengri - instead they focus on the defence of their homelands. The troops of the defensive pagans are more powerful than those of other religions, especially in counties of their own religion. Defensive pagans also have larger garrisons in their homelands.
RAISE_COUNTY_FLEETS	Raise County Fleets	Even though you are not playing as a Pagan you will find that they are bound to influence your game in many ways. This Hint screen will explain how their unique gameplay affects you, which can be useful even if you are a Crusader Kings II veteran.
TECH_DEM_INC_EMPERORS	§G+$AMOUNT$§! Demesne size for Emperors	The first thing to be aware of when dealing with Pagans is that they are much more aggressive than other, more 'civilized' religions. They can conquer or subjugate each other at will and are always a threat to their neighbours due to their looting and their powerful troops. A wise leader will know when to strike at them however, for their realms are far less stable than ours, especially in the early years of a new chieftain.
TECH_DEM_INC_KINGS	§G+$AMOUNT$§! Demesne size for Kings	Any county that borders a Pagan realm or that the Vikings can access via sea or river is at risk of their raids. Vikings will come in their ships, and steppe nomads on horses from the vast Tartar wastes. As they siege our counties, they loot and pillage the countryside, which will temporarily lower the tax income, so it is important to raise an army and chase them out. If they manage to actually occupy holdings, they can pillage these even further, burning down buildings, or even entire holdings. We can prevent this mainly by building forts - the fort level prevents looting, and heavily fortified counties can even block the Vikings' ability to sail down rivers.
TECH_DEM_INC_DUKES	§G+$AMOUNT$§! Demesne size for Dukes	The Pagan realms themselves are not the only threat - Vikings can declare their intention to invade a civilized country. Heathen adventurers from far and wide may then travel to join their ranks, boosting a normally harmless realm into a serious threat for even the mightiest of civilized rulers.
TECH_DEM_INC_COUNTS	§G+$AMOUNT$§! Demesne size for Counts	You can, of course, attempt to civilize these barbarians by sending our religious councillor to convert their rulers. If all else fails, you can also dominate them with Holy Wars, but you should be aware of how powerful the Pagan armies can be, especially when entrenched in their homelands, where their holdings will be hard to besiege and their troops will be much tougher to beat on the battlefield. Worst of all, it is far harder for us to forage in the hostile forests and marshes of the heathen homelands. Luckily, this harsh penalty can be overcome - either if the Pagans reform their religion and society to a point where we could almost consider them civilized, or if our technology reaches a high enough level.

EVTNAME_TOG_007	The Fall of Rome	Raven God have mercy!
EVTDESC_TOG_007	As is proper, Rome once more suffers at the just hands of warriors from the east. A Mongol army has breached the Aurelian Walls, and its horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while the ranking officers raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill. As expected, no mercy is shown to those foolish Romans who have not yet fled the city.

EVTDESC_TOG_012	The city of Prague has indeed become a beacon of light in an otherwise dark world, as Mongol warriors move from house to house and set fire to everything not yet looted.

EVTNAME_TOG_013	The Fall of Vienna	Prepare an Invasion of Scotland\n
EVTDESC_TOG_013	Vienna, a city previously of growing importance on the Danube river, has become the latest target of the great Mongol armies as they continue to pillage and burn their way across Europe. The smoking ruins and arrow-riddled corpses they leave behind when they move on do not lend much faith in the city's future prospects.

EVTDESC_TOG_014	The great Mongol horde has reached beyond the Carpathians and fanned out across the Great Hungarian Plain.

Those that attempt to flee on foot are cut down without mercy by the fast horsemen as dark, billowing smoke rises towards the sky above the city.	The Fall of Kiev
EVTNAME_TOG_015	The Fall of Athens	Brave Mongol warriors have poured through the Golden Gates of Kiev and sacked the once proud trading hub. The city has been left a smoldering ruin and the Dnieper now runs red with the blood of its former inhabitants.
EVTDESC_TOG_015	The ancient city of Athens has fallen to the Mongols, and they now rampage unchecked behind its walls. Great monuments and artifacts dating back to the dawn of Western Civilisation are lost forever in a cultural desecration that will surely be felt by future generations thousands of years from now.	They shall never forget our might.
EVTNAME_TOG_016	The Fall of Belgrade	The Fall of Novgorod
EVTDESC_TOG_016	The White City has turned red as the Mongol armies seize Belgrade and massacre the inhabitants without exception. After several days of slaughter and looting, the smell of death and rotting flesh proves too much even for our warriors to bear and they move their camp upwind from the scorched ruins of the city.	Novgorod has been stormed by Mongol warriors and the city's inhabitants are now paying the ultimate price for their arrogance. The Cathedral of Saint Sophia is engulfed in flames as the warriors loot that which can be carried away and put the rest to the torch.
EVTNAME_TOG_017	The Fall of Baghdad	The Fall of Krakow
EVTDESC_TOG_017	The decadent city of Baghdad, supposedly one of the world's foremost centers of learning, has succumbed to the unstoppable Mongol armies after a siege. Now the Tigris river runs not only red with blood, but black with the ink of priceless and irreplaceable tomes from the House of Wisdom and the city's other great libraries.	Mongol armies continue to push beyond the Vistula and into Poland. Krakow has now fallen to the skilled warriors, and it is said that at night the flames from the burning city can be seen from untold leagues away.
EVTNAME_TOG_018	The Fall of Damascus	The Fall of Aachen
EVTDESC_TOG_018	Damascus, the ancient City of Jasmine, has been sacked by the advancing Mongols. Our warriors have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed burj al-ru'us by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.	Even Aachen, the former seat of Charlemagne's Carolingian empire, has fallen under the shadow of the great Mongol nation. His spirit must surely be weeping at the harsh punishment now being brought down on the decadent peasants within the city's walls.
EVTNAME_TOG_019	The Fall of Jerusalem	The Fall of Paris
EVTDESC_TOG_019	The great Mongol host has sacked Jerusalem, spurring a moment of rare solidarity between members of all the city's different religions as they suffer equal horrors under the righteous wrath of our warriors.	Like a swarm of locusts, the unstoppable Mongols have descended upon Paris and sacked the city. The still unfinished Notre Dame Cathedral is quickly set on fire and with the light provided by the rest of the burning city, the Mongol warriors can continue looting and murdering well into the night.
EVTNAME_TOG_020	The Fall of Alexandria	The Fall of London
EVTDESC_TOG_020	Not content with our vast empire surpassing Alexander the Great's in sheer size, Mongol armies are now laying waste to the city that is his namesake as well. Pompey's Pillar has been toppled, but sadly the Pharos Lighthouse is spared when the our warriors deem it not worth the great effort it would require to raze it to the ground.	Not even the sea has proved a formidable enough barrier to halt the Mongol advance. London has fallen to the Mongol vanguard and the city is now the scene of a slaughter on a scale unrivaled since the days of Queen Boudica and her rebellion.
EVTNAME_TOG_021	The Fall of Cairo	The Fall of Rome
EVTDESC_TOG_021	Riding through the fertile Nile Delta, a Mongol army has arrived at the Great Pyramids of Giza and breached the gates of Cairo. Surely even the cruelest Pharaoh would be given pause by the pain and misery now inflicted on the city's decadent and foolish population.	As is proper, Rome once more suffers at the just hands of warriors from the east. A Mongol army has breached the Aurelian Walls, and its horses are now grazing on the field of the Circus Maximus while the ranking officers raise their yurts on the Palatine Hill. As expected, no mercy is shown to those foolish Romans who have not yet fled the city.
EVTNAME_TOG_022	The Fall of Mecca	The Fall of Venice
EVTDESC_TOG_022	The Muslim Holy City of Mecca now burns at the hands of Mongol warriors. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This desecration will be remembered for ages to come, hopefully as an important lesson on the price of defying the powerful Mongol nation.	The canals of Venice have been blocked by the bloated corpses of the dead as the city is sacked by frenzied Mongol warriors. Those few fortunate enough to have escaped the slaughter claim the bodies are packed tightly enough in the Venetian Lagoon for the Mongols to ride to and from the mainland as they please.

Our warriors have gathered a colossal pile of severed heads on a field just outside the city walls, now renamed burj al-ru'us by the massacre's few survivors - the Tower of Heads.
EVTDESC_TOG_501	The artisans who will carve and paint the runestone are asking for instructions. Which of your qualities should it speak of?	The Fall of Jerusalem

EVTOPTF_TOG_501	My wisdom must be preserved.	The Fall of Mecca
EVTOPTI_TOG_501	Uhm... you decide...	The Muslim Holy City of Mecca now burns at the hands of Mongol warriors. Pilgrims journeying from distant lands to show their submission to Allah are met only with death when approaching the city gates. This desecration will be remembered for ages to come, hopefully as an important lesson on the price of defying the powerful Mongol nation.

EVTDESC_TOG_402	After hearing stories of new land even further west of Greenland, Leif Eriksson, the son of Erik the Red, has mounted an expedition with a single longship and a crew of thirty-five. Days were spent at sea, but Leif and his crew finally sighted land and traveled south along the coast until they decided to winter at a place he named Vinland. When they returned to Greenland, the brave explorers brought with them a cargo of grapes and some much needed timber.\n\nUpon Leif's return, his brother Thorvald departed on a similar expedition to further map the coastline of this new land, but his shore party came to blows with Skrælings, the local natives, and Thorvald himself fell in battle.

The explorer Thorfinn Karlsefni sailed towards Vinland with three full longships, intending to establish a permanent settlement in the new world. Sadly, while sailing further south along the coast of Vinland, they came upon a large party of heavily armed Skræling warriors.\n\nThe Skrælings butchered the Norsemen and captured two of the three longships. Thorfinn himself was apparently sacrificed to their vengeful gods, but a few of his men were released so that they could bring warning back to Greenland. According to the survivors, the Skrælings then sailed the captured ships south, towards the cities of their great realm, where our ship-building techniques will be studied by their learned men.	Sami

EVTOPTB_TOG_610	No, I have changed my mind.	Sacrificed to the Gods
EVTDESC_TOG_611	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] steadies [From.GetHerselfHimself] and murmurs several passages that you recognize as being from the Christian holy book.	You begin preparations for the blot.
EVTOPTA_TOG_611	Where is your Blessed Virgin now, [From.GetFirstName]?	The hangman readies his rope.
EVTOPTB_TOG_611	No, perhaps this is a bad idea...	Vassal opinion increases by §G+15§! for §Y12§! months.\nYou move inside the large feast hall...
EVTDESC_TOG_612	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck while [From.GetSheHe] murmurs a passage with closed eyes from the Mohammedan holy book.	You watch as the dancing flames rise towards the sky.
EVTOPTA_TOG_612	Soon you shall meet your Prophet, friend.	It looks like spring shall come this year.
EVTOPTB_TOG_612	No, perhaps this is a bad idea...	You have sent out summons to all of your vassals for the blot. Those that have been baptized or profess to follow the teachings of the Prophet will have to offer gold to be exempted from this magnificent feast.
EVTDESC_TOG_613	Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from his dungeon and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around his neck, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...	I can hardly wait!
EVTOPTA_TOG_613	I'm afraid not. Do it, men.	Summoned to blot.
EVTOPTB_TOG_613	No, I can't do this to my own brother...	Exempted from blot.
EVTDESC_TOG_614	Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up from her dungeon and escorted to the temple. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your guards place the noose around her neck. Please, [Root.GetFirstName], she says with a trembling voice. Don't let them do this.	Your wise liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has summoned you and [From.GetHerHis] other vassals to a blot. There you will worship and give sacrifice to the gods before taking part in a great feast where you drink to their name.
EVTOPTA_TOG_614	There can be no turning back now. I'm sorry.	I wouldn't miss it.
EVTOPTB_TOG_614	No... not my own sister...	Your liege, [From.GetTitledFirstName], remains trapped in [From.GetHerHis] heathen ways, and now [From.GetSheHe] has summoned all of [From.GetHerHis] vassals to a blot where [From.GetSheHe] intends to give sacrifice to [From.GetHerHis] pagan gods. Since you do not practise their heathen religion, you will be expected to contribute gold in order to be exempted from this ceremony.
EVTDESC_TOG_615	The guards drag your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and escort him to the temple where they place the noose around his neck. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?	I suppose I have no choice in the matter.
EVTOPTA_TOG_615	No.	As [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap] is my witness, I shan't pay!
EVTOPTB_TOG_615	I can't do this to my own father...	Your payment is received.
EVTDESC_TOG_616	Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from her dungeon. They bring her to the temple and as they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?	[From.GetTitledFirstName], your vassal, is stubborn in [From.GetHerHis] ways and speaks only of the mercy of [From.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap], but [From.GetSheHe] has wisely decided to offer you some gold to be exempted from the blot.
EVTOPTA_TOG_616	Because I can.	As well [From.GetSheHe] should.
EVTOPTB_TOG_616	I... I wouldn't...	Your refusal to pay is received.
EVTDESC_TOG_617	The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and lead him to the temple. There a noose is placed around his neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. Before your men pull at the rope, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.	Despite having sworn you fealty, [From.GetTitledFirstName] refuses to offer gold in order to be exempted from the blot! According to [From.GetFirstName], [From.Religion.GetRandomGodName] would not forgive [From.GetHerHim] if [From.GetSheHe] contributed as much as a single copper to a heathen festival.
EVTOPTA_TOG_617	Do it, men.	This insult will not be forgotten.
EVTOPTB_TOG_617	I can't do this... not to my own boy...	The guests have arrived, and the time has come for the blot to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshippers themselves.
EVTDESC_TOG_618	Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from her dungeon and brought to the temple by your guards. As they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?	Now for the human sacrifice...
EVTOPTA_TOG_618	You have left me with little choice.	The time has come for the blot held by [From.GetTitledFirstName] to begin! You gather outside the temple, and start by offering animals as sacrifice to the gods. While their meat is prepared for the feast that is to follow, the blood is sprinkled on statues of Odin, Thor, Freyr and the other gods, as well as on the worshippers themselves.
EVTOPTB_TOG_618	No, send her back... not to my girl...	Although you have been told little, the noise from outside your dungeon is enough to make it clear that your captor, [Root.Host.GetTitledFirstName] is holding a blot where [Root.Host.GetSheHe] will offer sacrifice in worship of [Root.Host.GetHerHis] gods. Guards burst inside your cell and drag you away to the gallows outside the local temple... 
EVTDESC_TOG_619	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from your dungeons by the guards and placed at the gallows in front of the temple. As they place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!	No! Not like this!
EVTOPTA_TOG_619	Yes, and that only proves my devotion to Odin.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. A noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. A small yellow pool forms at [From.GetFirstName]'s feet.
EVTOPTB_TOG_619	It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.	Allfather, we offer you this sacrifice...
EVTDESC_TOG_620	Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the gallows in front of the temple and your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck. In a last desperate effort to save  [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.	No, I have changed my mind.
EVTOPTA_TOG_620	Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] steadies [From.GetHerselfHimself] and murmurs several passages that you recognize as being from the Christian holy book.
EVTOPTB_TOG_620	No, this is too much... I can't permit it.	Where is your Blessed Virgin now, [From.GetFirstName]?
EVTDESC_TOG_621	From deep within your dungeons, your guards bring out [From.GetTitledFirstName], your Skræling prisoner. As they drag [From.GetHerHim] to the front of the temple and place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, the Skræling shouts something in [From.GetHerHis] own language and stares at you defiantly.	No, perhaps this is a bad idea...
EVTOPTA_TOG_621	Let us show you how a proper human sacrifice is done.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck while [From.GetSheHe] murmurs a passage with closed eyes from the Mohammedan holy book.
EVTOPTB_TOG_621	No, this brave Skræling shall live to see another day.	Soon you shall meet your Prophet, friend.
EVTDESC_TOG_622	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the great oak in front of the temple and a noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body dangles limply in the cold breeze from one of the tree branches.	No, perhaps this is a bad idea...
EVTOPTA_TOG_622	This should please the gods!	Your brother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is brought up from his dungeon and escorted to the temple. As the noose is placed around his neck, he looks at you with pleading eyes. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]. There has to be some other way...
EVTDESC_TOG_623	Your liege's guards have brought a Christian, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the big oak in front of the temple. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to prattle on about the Holy Spirit and how we shall all suffer in Hell for our sins... but soon [FromFrom.GetSheHe] speaks no more.	I'm afraid not. Do it, men.
EVTDESC_TOG_624	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a Mohammedan from your liege's dungeons, has been brought to the temple and will now be sacrificed to the gods. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] quotes a passage from their holy book right up until the rope tightens and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] feet rise off the ground.	No, I can't do this to my own brother...
EVTDESC_TOG_625	Your liege has told [From.GetHerHis] men to fetch [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own brother, from the dungeons. [From.GetFirstName] betrays no emotion as [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is brought up to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon his limp body can be seen slowly dangling back and forth in the wind.	Your sister, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up from her dungeon and escorted to the temple. She looks up at you with tears streaming down her face as your guards place the noose around her neck. Please, [Root.GetFirstName], she says with a trembling voice. Don't let them do this.
EVTDESC_TOG_626	It seems your liege has decided to sacrifice [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own sister, to the gods. She has been brought out from [From.GetFirstName]'s dark dungeons, and while she squints her eyes in the unfamiliar daylight, the guards place a noose around her neck. Moments later her eyes are forever dead and listless.	There can be no turning back now. I'm sorry.
EVTDESC_TOG_627	To your surprise, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orders [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guards to bring out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] - [FromFrom.GetHerHis] own father. He is brought to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon he joins the others hanging limply from the branches with dead, gaping eyes.	No... not my own sister...
EVTDESC_TOG_628	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the mother of your liege, appears at the temple flanked by guards, and to your surprise they escort her right up to the gallows. She pleads in vain with [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] will not be moved. Within moments, she dangles next to the other offerings in the trees outside the temple.	The guards drag your father, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and escort him to the temple where they place the noose around his neck. My [Root.GetSonDaughter], he croaks while looking at you. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?
EVTDESC_TOG_629	[From.GetTitledFirstName] marches [From.GetTitledHerHis] own son, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gallows outside the temple. He is to be the next sacrifice. All of his pleas fall on deaf ears, and moments later the guards place the noose around his neck and he is made forever silent.	No.
EVTDESC_TOG_630	Those assembled at the blot gasp in surprise when [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], daughter of [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up to the gallows for the next sacrifice. She asks her [From.GetFatherMother] for mercy, but none is forthcoming.	I can't do this to my own father...
EVTDESC_TOG_631	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a member of [From.GetFirstName]'s own extended family, is dragged from the dungeons and brought to the temple. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that they are of the same blood, [From.GetFirstName] shows no mercy and the sacrifice takes place as planned.	Distant screaming can be heard as your guards drag your mother, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from her dungeon. They bring her to the temple and as they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with pleading eyes. W-why would you do this to your own mother?
EVTDESC_TOG_632	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decided to sacrifice [From.GetHerHis] own spouse, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gods, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been brought in chains to the temple. Despite professing [FromFrom.GetHerHis] continued love, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to go ahead with the sacrifice.	Because I can.
EVTDESC_TOG_633	In honor of this blot, your liege produces a Skræling from deep within [From.GetHerHis] dungeons. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is brought to the temple for the sacrifice, and everyone agrees that this is a most worthy sacrifice.	I... I wouldn't...
EVTDESC_TOG_634	As you have no prisoners languishing in your dungeons that are suitable for sacrifice at the blot, you are forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.	The guards fetch your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], from his dungeon and lead him to the temple. There a noose is placed around his neck and the rope is thrown over a sturdy branch of a nearby oak. Before your men pull at the rope, your son looks at you with tearful eyes. Please don't, [Root.GetFatherMother]... please don't.
EVTOPTA_TOG_634	It is better than nothing.	Do it, men.
EVTDESC_TOG_635	As [From.GetTitledFirstName] had no prisoners languishing in [From.GetHerHis] dungeons that were suitable for sacrifice at the blot, your liege was forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.	I can't do this... not to my own boy...
EVTOPTA_TOG_635	Better than nothing, I suppose.	Your daughter, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is pulled from her dungeon and brought to the temple by your guards. As they place the noose around her neck, she looks at you with a desperate yet piercing glare. Is this really what you have been reduced to, [Root.GetFatherMother]? To do this... against your own daughter?
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_637	Execution is stayed.	You have left me with little choice.
EVTDESC_TOG_637	As you stand trembling with the noose around your neck, [From.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly seems to have had a change of mind. The noose is removed and you are brought back to the dungeon. It looks like you will live to see another day.	No, send her back... not to my girl...
EVTOPTA_TOG_637	I... how... what?	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought from your dungeons by the guards and placed at the gallows in front of the temple. As they place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] cries out to you. Don't do this, [Root.GetFirstName]! We are family and of the same blood!
EVTDESC_TOG_640	With the sacrifice over, the feast at the end of the blot can now begin. The meat of the animals that were sacrificed has already been prepared, and there is plenty of mead to go around.	Yes, and that only proves my devotion to Odin.
EVTOPTA_TOG_640	Let the celebrations begin!	It is true... [From.GetSheHe] is kin.
EVTOPTA_TOG_641	About time!	Your spouse, [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged to the gallows in front of the temple and your guards place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck. In a last desperate effort to save  [From.GetHerselfHimself], [From.GetFirstName] calls out to you for mercy. I have always loved you, [Root.GetFirstName]... and I always will.
EVTDESC_TOG_642	The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until you hold the next one, but as your vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.	Forgive me then, my love, but this is how it must be.
EVTOPTA_TOG_642	Until next time!	No, this is too much... I can't permit it.
EVTDESC_TOG_643	The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until your liege holds the next one, but as you and the other vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.	From deep within your dungeons, your guards bring out [From.GetTitledFirstName], your Skræling prisoner. As they drag [From.GetHerHim] to the front of the temple and place the noose around [From.GetHerHis] neck, the Skræling shouts something in [From.GetHerHis] own language and stares at you defiantly.
EVTDESC_TOG_650	The mead and the spirits being served at the feast have gotten the better of you. You tried to be strong this time, and you did your best to stay away, but the pull was just too great...	Let us show you how a proper human sacrifice is done.
EVTOPTA_TOG_650	*hic* Letsch drrink s-schome morr... 	No, this brave Skræling shall live to see another day.
EVTDESC_TOG_651	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been drinking more and more since the feast began, and [From.GetSheHe] has now reached a point where [From.GetSheHe] he can no longer stand upright. Surrounded by empty tankards and singing at the top of [From.GetHerHis] lungs, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying on the table amidst the food.	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is dragged to the great oak in front of the temple and a noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck. Soon [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s body dangles limply in the cold breeze from one of the tree branches.
EVTOPTA_TOG_651	I think [From.GetSheHe] has had enough.	This should please the gods!
EVTOPTB_TOG_651	*hic* I k-know thisch schong!	Your liege's guards have brought a Christian, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the big oak in front of the temple. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] continues to prattle on about the Holy Spirit and how we shall all suffer in Hell for our sins... but soon [FromFrom.GetSheHe] speaks no more.
EVTDESC_TOG_653	Your mouth waters as servants place tray after tray of food on the table, and when the other guests engage in conversation, the only sounds coming from your corner are grunts and burps as you begin stuffing yourself. A sudden nausea sets in and you hurry towards the exit, but only make it as far as the lap of [From.GetTitledFirstName]...	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a Mohammedan from your liege's dungeons, has been brought to the temple and will now be sacrificed to the gods. As the noose is placed around [FromFrom.GetHerHis] neck, [FromFrom.GetSheHe] quotes a passage from their holy book right up until the rope tightens and [FromFrom.GetHerHis] feet rise off the ground.
EVTOPTA_TOG_653	UUAARGGHHHH...	Your liege has told [From.GetHerHis] men to fetch [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own brother, from the dungeons. [From.GetFirstName] betrays no emotion as [FromFrom.GetFirstName] is brought up to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon his limp body can be seen slowly dangling back and forth in the wind.
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_654	Is vomited on.	It seems your liege has decided to sacrifice [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], [From.GetHerHis] own sister, to the gods. She has been brought out from [From.GetFirstName]'s dark dungeons, and while she squints her eyes in the unfamiliar daylight, the guards place a noose around her neck. Moments later her eyes are forever dead and listless.
EVTDESC_TOG_654	Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as your seat before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into your lap...	To your surprise, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] orders [FromFrom.GetHerHis] guards to bring out [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] - [FromFrom.GetHerHis] own father. He is brought to the gallows in front of the temple, and soon he joins the others hanging limply from the branches with dead, gaping eyes.
EVTOPTA_TOG_654	Those were my best trousers!	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], the mother of your liege, appears at the temple flanked by guards, and to your surprise they escort her right up to the gallows. She pleads in vain with [From.GetTitledFirstName], but [From.GetSheHe] will not be moved. Within moments, she dangles next to the other offerings in the trees outside the temple.
EVTDESC_TOG_655	Morsels of food and clean-picked bones fly everywhere from the direction of [From.GetTitledFirstName] as [From.GetSheHe] greedily stuffs [From.GetHerselfHimself] with the delicacies served at the table. Suddenly [From.GetHerHis] face turns a strange shade of green, and [From.GetSheHe] rushes towards the exit but only make it as far as [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] before [From.GetSheHe] starts retching [From.GetHerHis] stomach contents into poor [FromFrom.GetFirstName]'s lap...	[From.GetTitledFirstName] marches [From.GetTitledHerHis] own son, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gallows outside the temple. He is to be the next sacrifice. All of his pleas fall on deaf ears, and moments later the guards place the noose around his neck and he is made forever silent.
EVTOPTA_TOG_655	That could have been me...	Those assembled at the blot gasp in surprise when [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], daughter of [From.GetTitledFirstName], is dragged up to the gallows for the next sacrifice. She asks her [From.GetFatherMother] for mercy, but none is forthcoming.
EVTDESC_TOG_656	As you enjoy the feast, you are struck by the warmth and kindness of those sitting next to you at the table. In fact, it's getting just a little too warm. You strip off your clothes and jump up on the table. Help, I'm on fire! you scream at the top of your lungs while waving your arms as the other bewildered guests look on.	[FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], a member of [From.GetFirstName]'s own extended family, is dragged from the dungeons and brought to the temple. Despite, or perhaps because of, the fact that they are of the same blood, [From.GetFirstName] shows no mercy and the sacrifice takes place as planned.
EVTOPTA_TOG_656	Put me out, put me out!	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has apparently decided to sacrifice [From.GetHerHis] own spouse, [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName], to the gods, and [FromFrom.GetSheHe] has been brought in chains to the temple. Despite professing [FromFrom.GetHerHis] continued love, [From.GetFirstName] has decided to go ahead with the sacrifice.
EVTDESC_TOG_657	You are enjoying the feast when a shrill scream from the other end of the room suddenly draws your attention. Stark naked, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is running around on the table waving [From.GetHerHis] arms while screaming that [From.GetSheHe] is on fire. You groan and bury your face in your hands.	In honor of this blot, your liege produces a Skræling from deep within [From.GetHerHis] dungeons. [FromFrom.GetTitledFirstName] is brought to the temple for the sacrifice, and everyone agrees that this is a most worthy sacrifice.
EVTOPTA_TOG_657	That lunatic...	As you have no prisoners languishing in your dungeons that are suitable for sacrifice at the blot, you are forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.
EVTOPTB_TOG_657	So [From.GetSheHe] is! And... and so am I! AAAHHH!	It is better than nothing.
EVTDESC_TOG_658	One of the serving girls has been eyeing you ever since you arrived at the feast, and now, fortified with mead, your hands grope at her body and she returns the favor. You pull off each other's clothes and give in to passion. Just as you join in her screams of pleasure, it dawns on you that you're doing this in full view of all the other stunned guests...	As [From.GetTitledFirstName] had no prisoners languishing in [From.GetHerHis] dungeons that were suitable for sacrifice at the blot, your liege was forced to make do with some randomly purchased thralls. They are brought to the big oak outside the temple, and soon their limp and lifeless bodies are hanging from its thick branches.
EVTOPTA_TOG_658	Oops...	Better than nothing, I suppose.
EVTOPTB_TOG_658	[Root.Spouse.GetFirstName] will not be happy about this...	Execution is stayed.
EVTDESC_TOG_659	You are conversing with another guest when loud screams of passion interrupt. In one corner of the room, in full view of everyone else, [From.GetTitledFirstName] is engaged in carnal pleasures with one of the serving girls. Both are completely naked, and only when they notice the stunned silence in the room do they seem to remember where they are.	As you stand trembling with the noose around your neck, [From.GetTitledFirstName] suddenly seems to have had a change of mind. The noose is removed and you are brought back to the dungeon. It looks like you will live to see another day.
EVTOPTA_TOG_659	By [This.Religion.GetRandomGodNameCap]...	I... how... what?
EVTOPTB_TOG_659	Haha, you old dog! Nicely done!	With the sacrifice over, the feast at the end of the blot can now begin. The meat of the animals that were sacrificed has already been prepared, and there is plenty of mead to go around.
EVTOPTC_TOG_659	No! [From.GetFirstName], what have you done?!	Let the celebrations begin!
EVTDESC_TOG_661	You have been seated next to [From.GetTitledFirstName] for the duration of the feast, and you have found [From.GetHerHim] to be a most agreeable person. There seems to be much you have in common.	About time!
EVTOPTA_TOG_661	It would seem I have a new friend.	The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until you hold the next one, but as your vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.
EVTDESC_TOG_664	Your mind wanders as you sit at your table during the feast, when suddenly you lock eyes with [From.GetTitledFirstName]. Something about [From.GetHerHis] gaze seems to reach into your heart, and when [From.GetSheHe] steps outside for some fresh air, you quickly excuse yourself to join [From.GetHerHim].	Until next time!
EVTOPTA_TOG_664	I thought I was the only one...	The feast is over and with it the blot. It will be at least nine years until your liege holds the next one, but as you and the other vassals return home, most seem to agree that the ceremony was well worth the trip.
EVTTOOLTIP_TOG_669	You are discovered!	The mead and the spirits being served at the feast have gotten the better of you. You tried to be strong this time, and you did your best to stay away, but the pull was just too great...
EVTDESC_TOG_669	You are locked in the embrace of your lover, and just as you kiss each other another guest wanders out of the feast hall and notices you. Though you immediately let go of each other, the damage is already done as the outraged guest rushes back inside to tell everyone what he saw.	*hic* Letsch drrink s-schome morr... 
EVTOPTA_TOG_669	It... it's not what it looks like!	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has been drinking more and more since the feast began, and [From.GetSheHe] has now reached a point where [From.GetSheHe] he can no longer stand upright. Surrounded by empty tankards and singing at the top of [From.GetHerHis] lungs, you find [From.GetFirstName] lying on the table amidst the food.
EVTDESC_TOG_670	With everything spinning from all the mead you drank, you stumble towards the exit to relieve yourself.

The berserker rage is upon you, but with great effort you manage to channel it towards the table instead of [FromFrom.GetFirstName]. With your axe you reduce the table to firewood, and as you lie panting in the wreckage, [FromFrom.GetFirstName] finally stops his tirade to ask: Are you feeling well, my [Root.GetTitle]?
EVTDESC_TOG_3125	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has come home from Miklagård and his service with the Varangian Guard, but he is not alone. He has found a Greek wife and brought her with him.

EVTDESC_TOG_3127	After many years in Greece, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally been released from his service to the Varangian Guard and returned home. Your son is a changed man, however. The old gods no longer hold any interest for him, and he instead speaks incessantly of Christendom and the horrors that await those who refuse to convert...	Yes... yes. I just need a moment to collect my wits.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3127	I knew those Greeks would be a bad influence.	Organize the Varangian Guard
EVTDESC_TOG_3129	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Miklagård and the Varangian Guard as a changed man. He is wiser, more confident in his own abilities and more knowledgeable in matters of war. It seems the time spent in Greece did him good.

EVTOPTA_TOG_3129	Welcome home, [From.GetFirstName]!	The Varangian Guard is formed.
EVTDESC_TOG_3131	Several former Varangian Guardsmen have recently returned home after serving the Greek king, and they bring news most grave. Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], fell in battle while campaigning in Serkland. They assure you that he faced his enemy with bravery and slew many before their numbers overwhelmed him.	The Varangian Guard
EVTOPTA_TOG_3131	He died a hero...	Varangian raiders sailing from the distant north down the rivers leading into the Black Sea have proven themselves to be formidable warriors. You have managed to recruit a great many of their number into a personal guard loyal only to the [Root.GetTitle].\n\nThis new Varangian Guard will not only form a powerful shock force against the Empire's many enemies, but their foreign roots should also preclude them from becoming too entangled in the palace intrigue and power struggles that are so commonplace in Constantinople.
EVTDESC_TOG_3133	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has at last returned from Greece on a longship filled with the spoils of war! Apparently the great king of the Greeks is generous to those who serve him well, and there is gold here from all over the Greek realm, Serkland and beyond. Your son insists on sharing these riches with you, his loving father.	They shall serve me well.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3133	[From.GetFirstName], you make me proud!	[From.GetFirstName], the great king of the Greeks, is distraught over the poor mettle of his countrymen. Knowing well our skill in battle, he has decided to form a bodyguard consisting solely of Norse warriors.\n\nThose who serve him in the great city of Miklagård are generously rewarded, and even now many of our young men, eager for riches and adventure, have departed for Greece to pick up his banner.
EVTDESC_TOG_3134	Upon learning of the death of your father, you left the Varangian Guard and departed Miklagård for home on a longship filled with loot from your campaigns in Serkland. It was a long and perilous journey back, but your feet are now firmly planted on the soil of the land that is your birthright. The throne is yours.	May they find the excitement they yearn.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3134	It is as I remember it.	Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has decided to enlist with the Varangian Guard in Miklagård and seek his fortune there! Although he will no doubt gain both riches and valuable battle experience in service of the Greek king, there will be many perils that could well cost him his life.

ca_wall_q_2	Castle Fortifications	Go to Miklagård and make me proud, son.
ca_wall_q_3	Castle Fortifications	A grizzled old warrior having just returned from Greece arrived with a message from [From.GetTitledFirstName] today. Though he has left the Varangian Guard, your son has apparently found himself a Greek wife and decided to remain in Miklagård and build a new life there. It is doubtful whether you will ever see him again...
ca_wall_q_4	Castle Fortifications	My boy...
ca_wall_q_5	Castle Fortifications	After finishing his service with the Varangian Guard, [From.GetTitledFirstName] has married a local woman and decided to remain in Constantinople instead of returning home to the barbaric frozen wasteland he once came from. He has pledged his continued service to you.
ca_wall_1	Castle Walls	Very well.
ca_wall_2	Castle Walls	A heavily scarred warrior clad in strange armor approaches your throne, and before he can be disarmed, the stranger relieves your guard of his spear in a swift, fluid motion and tosses it aside. Other guards hurry forward, but you raise your hand to stop them. The stranger is [From.GetTitledFirstName], at last returned from Greece!
ca_wall_3	Castle Walls	[From.GetFirstName]! You've... changed!
ca_wall_4	Castle Walls	Your son, [From.GetTitledFirstName], has finally returned home from Greece and his service with the Varangian Guard! Although you can't quite put your finger on it, he seems different somehow... and what is this Greek love he speaks of?
ca_wall_5	Castle Walls	No matter, I'm just glad he made it home!
ca_barracks_1	Barracks	A frail, robed man is led into your throne room, and your guards explain that he just arrived on a ship coming from Miklagård. The man would only speak your name over and over again, and so he was brought to you. To your horror, you recognize him at last as [From.GetTitledFirstName]!
ca_barracks_2	Barracks	[From.GetFirstName], what have they done to you?!
ca_barracks_3	Barracks	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has finally returned home after a long and successful career in the Varangian Guard! He fought in several battles, and learned much from the clever strategies and tactics favored by both the Greeks and their enemies in Serkland.
ca_barracks_4	Barracks	Tell me of your battles, [From.GetFirstName]...
ca_barracks_5	Barracks	[From.GetTitledFirstName] has returned from Greece and the Varangian Guard, but he refuses to speak of his experiences there.

You are not permitted to witness the sacred ritual itself, so you depart the grove and wait.	A faint whisper draws your attention and you find a haggard old crone in a dark corner of your longhouse.

EVTDESC_TOG_3256	The incantations from the grove suddenly stop, and several maidens, their white gowns red with someone else's blood, run past screaming.

EVTDESC_TOG_3218	The corpse of [From.GetTitledName] was discovered today at the bottom of a steep ravine with a broken neck.

EVTOPTA_TOG_3218	Curious...	[From.GetFirstName]'s behavior concerns you sometimes.
EVTDESC_TOG_3221	[From.GetTitledName] was found impaled on a wooden fence just outside your longhouse this morning.

He has led his armies west and now stands poised to punish the powerful Muslim realm for its insolence. Like a coiled spring, the massed Mongol armies are ready to be unleashed upon the world.

[FromFrom.GetFirstName] must be purged of the evil [FromFrom.GetSheHe] carries within [FromFrom.GetHerHim]. There is no other way. I can perform a galdr ritual, but I won't lie - the child may or may not survive the ordeal. Nevertheless, the demon must be vanquished.
waldensian_DESC	Originally a reform movement within the Catholic church, Waldensian heretics are anti-clerical and advocate a return to vows of poverty. They are opposed to capital punishment and believe that laymen can also administer the sacraments. This heresy has no formal head and no special game mechanics.	Perform the ritual.
lollard_DESC	Lollard heretics are opposed to perceived corruption within the Catholic Church. Like many Catholic heresies, they loathe the wealth and ostentation of the clergy and advocate a return to a more original form of Christianity. This heresy has no formal head and no special game mechanics.	If you so much as touch [FromFrom.GetFirstName]...
orthodox_DESC	The Orthodox Church is the other main branch of Chalcedonian Christianity that up until 1054 was formally united with the Catholic Church, although the political division can be traced back to the crowning of Charlemagne as Roman Emperor by Pope Leo III in 800, which did not sit well with the Emperor in Constantinople. The nominal head of the Orthodox Church is the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, but he does not interfere in the affairs of other Patriarchs.	The galdr ritual to cleanse your spawn of evil has begun. The child is brought to a raised platform in a grove where [FromFrom.GetFirstName] awaits surrounded by chanting maidens. You are not permitted to witness the sacred ritual itself, so you depart the grove and wait.
miaphysite_DESC	Miaphysite Christianity encompasses the Coptic Church and the Armenian Apostolic Church. Miaphysites stress that Christ had but a single nature, but of both human and divine character. This stance split them off from the main branch of Christianity after the council of Chalcedon in 451.

Sunni Muslims hold strictly to the Sunnah - the sayings and actions of Muhammad - as collected in the Hadiths, which form the basis for Sunni jurisprudence. The formal head of Sunni Islam is the (Sunni) Caliph.	A solemn procession of maidens led by [From.GetTitledName] finally emerges from the grove, but there is no sign of [FromFrom.GetFirstName].

Try as they might, they haven't been able to force the chest open and its contents remain a mystery. It has now been deposited into your care.	After a brutal civil war, the decadent dynasty of my former liege has finally been overthrown by the [Root.Liege.GetOnlyDynastyName] clan. In the transitional chaos, I could probably get away with a declaration of independence...
EVTOPTA_TOG_3301	One day, that chest will be opened. Mark my words.	Stay Loyal
EVTDESC_TOG_3302	While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. As you examine it, the metal reminds you of that mysterious chest you recovered earlier. Perhaps there is a connection!	Freedom!
EVTOPTA_TOG_3302	Let us see if the key will fit!	After a successful siege, your men drag §Y[From.GetTitledName]§! out of [From.GetHerHis] hiding hole.
EVTDESC_TOG_3303	While looting the holding, one of your men came upon a strange looking key made of an unknown metal. You have only seen such a metal once before  that mysterious chest that has been inherited and passed along in your family. It's still gathering dust somewhere in your chambers... could this be the key that opens it?	Off to the dungeons with [From.GetHerHim]!
EVTOPTA_TOG_3303	Let us find out! 	Raised Runestone
EVTDESC_TOG_3306	The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. It is filled with ancient gold coins, carved with the likeness of the long-dead Emperors of Rome and words written in their strange language!	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. When [From.GetSheHe] sees the dangling noose about to be placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetSheHe] pushes the nearest guard aside and makes a desperate run for it, but to no avail. Your men drag [From.GetHerHim] kicking and screaming back to the temple.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3306	A small fortune!	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. Even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck, [From.GetFirstName] stares vacantly ahead without betraying any emotion whatsoever. It would seem [From.GetSheHe] has accepted [From.GetHerHis] fate.
EVTDESC_TOG_3307	The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Disappointingly, it contains only a few parched scrolls that crumble into dust at your touch. Whatever wisdom they held has been forever lost to the world.	[From.GetTitledFirstName] is brought up from your dungeons and escorted to the temple. As soon as [From.GetSheHe] spots you among those gathered nearby, [From.GetSheHe] hurls insults and spittle your way, continuing even as the noose is placed around [From.GetHerHis] neck. The hatred in [From.GetHerHis] eyes cannot be mistaken.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3307	Just my luck.	As your men return from looting the holding, one of them hands you an axe with a strange purple sheen and a plus etched into the handle, followed by the number two. After weighing it carefully in your hands, you toss aside your old, grey axe in favor of the new weapon.
EVTDESC_TOG_3308	The key fits the lock, and trembling with anticipation you slowly open the chest. Sadly, it is filled with nothing but worthless baubles and various trinkets. There is not a trace of gold to be found here, but the contents of the chest could probably be traded away for a few coins at least.	I feel stronger.
EVTOPTA_TOG_3308	Better than nothing, I suppose.	Through my sources I have learned that our mutual problem will be touring a city in an open carriage. The guards will keep a close watch on the streets, but will they expect bowmen on the rooftops?
EVTDESC_TOG_3309	The key fits the lock, and you slowly open the chest. It contains nothing but dust! As you run your hand through it, strange lights begin to manifest in the room and you close your eyes when the first ghostly apparitions appear. You hear the screams of your guards, and when you finally open your eyes again, the spectres are gone... and your guards have been reduced to ash.	Watching the animal pens outside [Root.Location.GetName] gave me an idea. Concentrated manure can be a very explosive substance, and if enough is gathered in a single place and ignited, the blast could prove lethal...
EVTOPTA_TOG_3309	This... this chest needs to be buried...	If that whelp we are plotting against is to die, we will need to buy the loyalty of someone unscrupulous nearby, like a maid or a guard.
opens_chest	You hurry to the chest...	The fact that the target of our plot is in prison can work to our advantage. If we could get someone on the inside to deal with our little problem and make it look like a failed escape attempt...
found_chest	You stow the chest safely away for now.	The target of our plot may be a drooling, incapable mess, but it is still a very much alive drooling, incapable mess. Every month servants give our little problem a sorely needed bath, during which so many things could go wrong... especially if those servants were in our employ.
chest_empty	You walk away disappointed.	Whispers have reached my ears that the target of the plot I am backing is due to embark on a little boat trip. I have it on good authority that the child has not yet learned to swim. If the boat was to flounder... well, these things happen all the time, don't they?
seraphims	You have the chest buried and vow never to speak a word of it to another soul.	There are snakes out there who can fell a grown man instantly with a single bite. If such a viper was to make a visit to a certain someone's bedchambers at night...
d_galloway_adj_welsh	Strathclyde	I have learned that our mutual problem likes to take in the morning air on a balcony. The fall would be a long one indeed if someone was to take a tumble from there... perhaps the railing could be adjusted slightly.
EVTDESC_TOG_3320	The pillaging and looting undertaken in your name has earned you a reputation as a fearsome Viking raider. All along the coasts, mothers tucking their children in for the night warn that unless they behave, the terrible [Root.GetFirstName], scourge of the seas, will come ashore with his undead warriors and eat them.	The young nuisance we are plotting against will soon be going on hunting trip to learn about the majesty of the wilds. With hounds and other dangerous beasts running around, not to mention arrows flying in every direction, so many things could go wrong during a hunt...
EVTOPTA_TOG_3320	I like the sound of that!	The target of the plot I am backing will soon travel by carriage on an isolated road. Perhaps if we gathered some mercenaries and disguised them as highwaymen... crime is on the rise, after all.
viking	Viking	The target we are plotting against will soon embark on a lengthy journey by carriage, during which so many things could go wrong. If we could buy the loyalty of the carriage driver...
viking_desc	This character has earned a reputation as a fearsome Viking raider.	During the battle, you fearlessly charged ahead on horseback directly into the enemy ranks. Members of your personal guard riding beside you tumbled off their horses as enemy arrows found their marks, but your charge plowed straight into the enemy skirmishers and your sword ran red with their blood.
EVTNAME39640	The Rise of the Shi'a	While riding ahead with your personal guard, you suddenly found yourselves isolated on the battlefield and surrounded by enemy soldiers. A violent melee ensued but you gave a good account of yourself and managed to return to the main body of your army in time to lead it to victory.
EVTDESC39640	The schism at the heart of Islam dates back to its earliest days. The majority Sunnis have long persecuted the followers of Ali, the Shias, forcing them into hiding. The partisans of Ali look to his descendants for leadership, but they are forced to keep their ancestry secret. Now though, the Shias are mobilizing their strength behind a boy whom they claim to be Ali's rightful heir and Imam. Other Islamic jurists claim that the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the person they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner.	You were in the thick of it during the battle, and your tally of slain enemy soldiers has impressed even the most grizzled sergeants in your army. As you clean the blood splatter off your sword and armor, the men cheer you for the bravery you displayed in securing this victory.
EVTOPTA39640	He is but a mere boy!	Using your foot as leverage, you pull your sword out of the dead corpse of the last foeman to fall by your hand in the battle. All around you, the men are cheering as the routing enemy soldiers flee in wild panic. Victory has been achieved, in large part thanks to your heroic efforts!
EVTOPTB39640	For Allah and Ali!	Your commanding presence on the battlefield was felt during the recent victory, by friends and foes alike. You bolstered the spirits of the men when it was needed most, and you personally led the final charge that broke the back of the enemy army.
EVTOPTC39640	The schismatics must be crushed!	As the enemy scurries away from the battlefield like frightened rabbits, you wipe the sweat off your brow and watch in silence. It was a hard-fought melee, and you were in the thick of it, personally leading your men to victory. Not only have you won this battle, but also a great deal of respect.
EVTOPTD39640	Ha! The fools fight amongst themselves.	Songs will be sung of this day.
